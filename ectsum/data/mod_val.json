    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Revenue totaled roughly $1.5 billion, showing a 7.5% decrease from the previous year, surpassing our projections and indicating ongoing gradual improvement.\nAs expected, the Aviation division remains the main cause of the revenue decline.\nBoth GAAP and adjusted earnings increased by over 160% compared to the same period last year.\nGAAP continuing earnings per share rose to $1.10, or $1.01 on an adjusted basis.\nAdjusted EBITDA margins grew by more than 400 basis points to 8.3% in comparison to the previous year.\nThese results were bolstered by high demand for more profitable Work Orders related to virus protection and our long-term EnhancedClean services.\nEfficient labor management continued to contribute to profitability.\nMost of our contracts are performance-based, so we benefit from any staffing efficiencies as occupancy decreases or schools adopt hybrid models.\nThis demonstrates the advantage of having a flexible workforce model.\nEarl will provide more detailed information about our segments, but overall, our industry group trends are similar to what we observed throughout the latter part of last year.\nAs expected, our Aviation and Technical Solutions segments faced challenges due to the pandemic, resulting from reduced global travel and limited access to sites for retrofit projects and educational facilities.\nHowever, the Education segment experienced growth in both revenue and profit during the quarter, demonstrating how well our team has adapted operationally to the hybrid learning system, while Business & Industry and Technology & Manufacturing continue to perform strongly.\nWe've managed to counterbalance COVID-related revenue decreases with higher-margin Work Orders, EnhancedClean contracts, and effective labor management.\nWe're approaching the one-year mark since the pandemic began, and I've just summarized our fourth consecutive quarter of strong performance.\nThis sustained success indicates that we've achieved a level of consistency in our results and stability across our client portfolio.\nI'll now share some thoughts on where we believe the operating environment is heading, particularly in light of our full-year guidance.\nBefore discussing what the path to normalcy looks like in 2021, I want to emphasize that normalcy doesn't mean reduced vigilance regarding virus protection.\nIn recent months, numerous news outlets and scientific journals have reminded us that COVID-19 and its effects will persist for the foreseeable future.\nMany experts believe it will become a permanent part of our lives, with people receiving regular vaccinations similar to how we handle flu shots.\nWe are very excited about the ongoing vaccine rollouts across the country.\nMost importantly, the vaccines will save lives, but they will also drive momentum for returning to work, school, travel, and attending entertainment venues.\nHowever, vaccine distribution has been inconsistent from state to state, as have state policies on mask-wearing, public gatherings, and other factors that impact infections and new cases.\nThese factors, along with the ongoing discovery of new variants, highlight how society's need to respond to COVID-19 at an elevated level will not end in the near future.\nThis is why it's crucial for us to collaborate with our clients, assess their evolving needs, and engage our expert advisory panel.\nIn the Business & Industry sector, vaccines will drive momentum for returning to work, which for us means a revival of more traditional janitorial work as well as continued disinfection due to higher occupancy.\nCurrently, average occupancy across the country is about 15%.\nWe expect this could increase to 25% by Labor Day and grow to over 50% by the end of the calendar year.\nAs clients plan their return, they are focusing on building trust in their facilities through health and safety protocols, with rigorous cleaning, disinfecting, and physical distancing being incorporated into their plans.\nFor this reason, we don't anticipate a near-term reduction in space utilization across commercial real estate, especially for Class A buildings and blue-chip clients.\nIn the education sector, we believe hybrid models will remain in effect for at least the rest of the school year.\nSoon, if not already, institutions will begin planning for the fall 2021 semester, with a push for more in-person learning in both K-12 and higher education.\nThe implementation may vary by region.\nWe should have a clearer picture when we speak to you after Q2 earnings.\nAs vaccine adoption continues to expand, there's likely no sector more poised for a robust volume recovery than Aviation.\nWe're definitely hearing about pent-up demand for personal travel and at least a modest return of business travel.\nFor ABM, our aviation business portfolio includes both airlines and airports.\nSince airports remained open during the pandemic, operations in areas like terminal cleaning, transportation, and shuttle services allowed us to mitigate reduced volumes on the airline side.\nUltimately, this diversification helped us break even last year, which was a significant achievement.\nOn the airline side, current travel volumes are approximately 50% of pre-COVID levels.\nAssuming vaccine rollouts gain traction, we believe we could see that grow moderately by year-end.\nAs both airlines and airports experience increased traffic, the need for disinfection, virus protection, and EnhancedClean services will grow.\nAt an enterprise level, we conducted a Pulse Survey of about 200 clients last month that largely aligned with our own full-year expectations.\nMost respondents anticipate their facilities will more fully reopen and their companies will endorse reoccupancy in various forms by September, and they plan to continue taking multiple measures to protect spaces against COVID-19 as they reopen, primarily in the areas of surface and air disinfection.\nEven with the increase in flexible work schedules and work-from-home protocols, the vast majority of our clients expect the total amount of space utilization to remain largely the same.\nWhile the size of our survey represents just a subset of our client base, it supports what we're hearing more broadly as we communicate with our customers about their future plans.\nIt also speaks to our confidence in providing full-year guidance today.\nFor fiscal 2021, we are introducing full-year guidance of earnings per diluted share of $2.85 to $3.10, or $3.00 to $3.25 on an adjusted basis.\nOur outlook for adjusted EBITDA margins is 6.6% to 7%, compared to 6% last year.\nWe also expect to return to growth by the second half of this year and see consistent demand for high-margin Work Orders and EnhancedClean services through year-end.\nWe also anticipate retaining most of our labor arbitrage through year-end.\nOur success will not lead to complacency.\nWe have been leveraging the pandemic's impact on our trajectory to boost our brand and business.\nABM debuted its first nationwide television commercial in late February.\nThe entire company celebrated this milestone achievement with great pride.\nYou can view the commercial on our investor relations website if you missed it on CNBC or Bloomberg TV.\nAs previously discussed, we plan to invest in our clients, employees, and infrastructure.\nWe're concentrating on enhancing client and employee experiences through technology and data analytics capabilities.\nWe're also emphasizing talent development to empower our staff and strengthen client relationships.\nWe are dedicated to enhancing our strong culture and creating an environment where team members feel included, appreciated, and motivated.\nThis aligns with our organizational mission and vision, leading to significant long-term business benefits.\nInternal programs like our culture and inclusion council aim to drive meaningful social change and foster an inclusive workplace at ABM.\nI'm pleased to announce that we've partnered with organizations dedicated to creating a more equitable society.\nABM has pledged support to the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Funds, Hispanic Scholarship Fund, Afterschool Alliance, and Thurgood Marshall College Fund.\nWe're collaborating with these organizations to make an impact in advocacy, civil rights, basic needs, education, and workforce development.\nWe had just begun discussing the coronavirus and its economic impact.\nI emphasized how our diverse portfolio and adaptable business model have been key to our long-term success over the past 110 years.\nOur performance over the last year has undoubtedly proven this, and our strong financial position makes us better equipped than ever to pursue growth and profitability, increasing shareholder value.\nThe commitment of the ABM team continues to drive our consistent quarterly performance.\nOur company culture is unparalleled in the industry.\nI'm proud that our results have clearly demonstrated our resilience, adaptability, and excellence.\nToday marks my 100th day at ABM, and my initial impressions of the organization's collaborative and execution-driven culture have only been reinforced.\nAs I continue to assess our business needs, I will focus on identifying the right catalysts for strategic growth and ongoing improvement.\nOur strong recent performance and market leadership position provide an excellent opportunity to invest in our future growth potential.\nI look forward to finalizing our internal investment strategy and sharing it with you throughout the year.\nLet's move on to the results.\nQuarterly revenue was $1.5 billion, a 7.5% decrease from last year.\nThe revenue decline reflects COVID-19's ongoing impact across our business segments.\nRemember, the pandemic didn't significantly affect operations until our second quarter last year, so this quarter shows the full year-over-year impact.\nThe revenue decline was partially offset by continued demand for higher-margin disinfection-related Work Orders and EnhancedClean services.\nWork Orders were particularly strong in our Business & Industry and Technology & Manufacturing sectors.\nOur GAAP income from continuing operations was $74.6 million or $1.10 per diluted share, compared to $27.9 million or $0.41 last year.\nThe increase was due to strong operational performance and favorable developments in prior year self-insurance adjustments.\nWe saw an $11.4 million benefit this year compared to $6.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2020.\nWe also recorded a positive insurance trend benefit of about $3 million for the second consecutive quarter.\nAdjusted income from continuing operations increased to $68.3 million or $1.01 per diluted share, up from $26.2 million or $0.39 last year.\nOur earnings growth was driven by significant increases in higher-margin Work Orders and EnhancedClean services.\nAs clients incorporate health and hygiene services into their operations, we continue to experience higher margins due to efficient labor management.\nResults also reflect one less working day, saving approximately $6 million in labor expenses.\nOther factors like reduced corporate discretionary expenses, amortization, and interest also contributed to the improved results.\nThese gains were partially offset by planned investments in infrastructure and organization, particularly in IT.\nHowever, our investment spend for the quarter was about $4 million, lower than initially expected.\nWe generated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $124 million, with a margin rate of 8.3%, compared to $68.8 million or 4.3% last year.\nNow, let's discuss our segment results.\nThese results reflect COVID-19's ongoing impact, which has led to revenue compression across our services.\nOur diversified segment structure has been advantageous during the pandemic, with each segment affected differently.\nMost segments show a mix shift towards higher Work Orders and EnhancedClean services, labor adjustments due to lower service demand, and operational investments in areas like EnhancedClean.\nB&I revenue was $809.4 million, down $11.5 million or 1.4% from last year.\nThe parking and sports and entertainment businesses were the main drivers of the revenue decline due to the pandemic.\nThis decline was almost entirely offset by increased demand for higher-margin Work Orders and EnhancedClean services from national accounts and corporate clients, particularly financial institutions.\nThe segment's operating profit reflected this more favorable business mix, resulting in $85.7 million or a 10.6% margin, compared to last year's $38.2 million and 4.7% respectively.\nTechnology & Manufacturing remains one of our most resilient segments.\nT&M delivered robust results for the quarter, maintaining its strong performance since the pandemic's onset.\nThe division reported $249.2 million in revenue, a 6.5% increase from the previous year, with an operating profit of $26.9 million, representing a 10.8% margin rate.\nDemand for T&M services was driven by work orders and EnhancedClean offerings, particularly in industrial manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, and high-tech industries.\nWe also saw growth with our logistics clients as we assisted them during the busy holiday period.\nOur Education division increased revenues to $209.4 million, with an operating profit of $21.5 million, equating to a 10.2% margin.\nWe believe these outcomes indicate some stabilization as schools have maintained the hybrid learning approach implemented since the latter half of last year.\nThe performance was mainly due to effective direct labor management resulting from adjusted staffing levels and other cost savings, as well as demand for disinfection and COVID-related work orders.\nGoing forward, we expect a partial return to a traditional selling season in 2021, which was largely absent last year due to the pandemic.\nWe are closely monitoring how schools will adapt their teaching methods in the current climate, especially as vaccine distribution progresses.\nAviation reported revenue of about $143 million with an operating profit of $3.2 million.\nAs expected, this segment remained the most affected by COVID-19 and its impact on global travel.\nThe quarter experienced a slight sequential increase in travel during the holiday season, but quickly reversed due to lockdowns in areas like the UK.\nWe continue to operate based on flight and passenger demand, offering advanced services such as electrostatic spraying while managing variable costs and expenses in real-time to match demand.\nTechnical Solutions reported revenue of $113 million compared to $142 million the previous year.\nThis decrease was caused by site access issues as clients, particularly in education, continued to restrict entry to their facilities to protect staff, teachers, and students.\nHowever, the backlog remains strong at over $150 million, and we are focused on completing these projects as quickly as possible.\nOperating profit was $6 million, representing a 5.3% margin.\nRegarding cash and liquidity, we reported positive cash flow in the first quarter, despite this typically being a cash flow negative period.\nThis includes the deferral of approximately $31 million in payroll taxes from the CARES Act.\nWe generated over $45 million in cash flow from operations and approximately $39 million in free cash flow for the quarter.\nOur strong performance allowed us to end the quarter with total debt, including standby letters of credit, of $851 million and a bank-adjusted leverage ratio of 1.8 times.\nAdditionally, we concluded the quarter with $378 million in cash and cash equivalents.\nGiven the consistency of our leverage and cash position over recent quarters, we believe we have achieved operational and financial stability.\nAs a result, we are reassessing our capital allocation priorities.\nIn addition to organic investments in our business, we are also exploring potential M&A targets to drive growth and build on our current momentum.\nWhile cautiously re-entering the M&A market, we will also consider opportunistic share repurchases.\nWe currently have about $145 million remaining in our authorized share repurchase program and will balance any potential activity with our M&A efforts to maintain maximum flexibility.\nDuring the quarter, we paid our 219th consecutive quarterly cash dividend of $0.19 per common share, totaling $12.7 million distributed to shareholders.\nRegarding our guidance outlook, we are introducing a fiscal 2021 GAAP guidance range of $2.85 to $3.10 and an adjusted range of $3.00 to $3.25 per share.\nBased on our first-quarter performance, we anticipate revenue will continue to improve sequentially, with a return to growth in the latter half of the year.\nAs growth improves and turns positive, we will need to increase staffing accordingly.\nThis may result in a partial reduction in the labor efficiencies we've experienced over the past year, but we expect to retain some of these savings based on new opportunities and labor management practices adopted during COVID.\nWe don't anticipate a significant decrease in demand for higher-margin Work Orders and EnhancedClean services for the remainder of the fiscal year.\nWe expect our investments to increase throughout the year as we support strategic initiatives, particularly in our IT transformation.\nYear-over-year, we anticipate an increase in corporate expenses for the year, although timing may vary quarter-to-quarter, as seen in the first quarter.\nAdditionally, we implemented furlough and expense reduction measures during the third quarter of last year, so we expect to see a year-over-year increase in expenses as we've resumed some of those expenditures.\nWe are still planning and designing our technology roadmap and will provide updates as we finalize our plans.\nIt's worth noting that we will have an extra working day in Q2 and one less working day in Q3.\nEach working day should represent approximately $6 million in labor expenses, similar to Q1.\nWe continue to expect an effective tax rate of about 30% for 2021.\nThis tax rate excludes discrete tax items such as the work opportunity tax credit and the tax impact of stock-based compensation awards.\nAt the end of December, WOTC was officially extended by Congress through 2025, with current estimates suggesting a $5 million or $0.07 impact on 2020.\nWhile we're not providing guidance on free cash flow until we can determine the impact of our tech transformation on capital expenditures, I want to express my enthusiasm for the strong start to the year.\nGiven our strong cash flow performance to date, we believe we'll be able to achieve a range above our historical $175 million to $200 million and look forward to updating you as we finalize our longer-term plan.\nIn conclusion, we're excited about our quarterly performance and our outlook for the year, and we look forward to updating you on our continued progress next quarter.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:The COVID-19 pandemic has created immense challenges globally, and we continue to support those affected.\nWe appreciate our employees and sales teams in Japan and the US for their dedication in assisting policyholders and communities impacted by the pandemic.\nOur focus remains on our core mission of offering protection products to help consumers in times of need.\nWhile the pandemic has affected our backlog, we maintain robust capital and liquidity positions.\nOur investments are well-diversified, high-quality, and generate some of the industry's best returns on capital with low costs.\nThis quarter was significantly influenced by new US tax regulations allowing greater use of foreign tax credits.\nOur Japanese subsidiary is taxed as a US domestic company for US tax purposes.\nWe recorded a cumulative year-to-date benefit of $202 million or $0.28 per share from these regulations compared to our previous rate.\nRegarding Aflac Japan, COVID-19 continued to impact our results, with sales declining 32% in the third quarter.\nAbout half our Japanese workforce is still working remotely, and customer traffic at shops remains at 70% of pre-pandemic levels.\nWhile sales have improved sequentially, reduced face-to-face interactions have clearly affected results, leading us to promote virtual sales methods.\nJapan has experienced political changes, with Prime Minister Suga succeeding long-serving Abe.\nWe expect Suga's administration to maintain policy continuity, fostering a favorable business climate and focusing on COVID-19 response and economic policies.\nSuga is pushing for regulatory reforms and digital transformation post-pandemic, aligning with Aflac Japan's ongoing paperless initiatives.\nIn Aflac US, COVID-19 also significantly impacted results, with third-quarter sales down 35.7% due to limited face-to-face interactions.\nBusiness closures and restricted worksite access have particularly affected our career agents who rely on in-person meetings with small business owners.\nWe're cautiously optimistic for modest sales improvement in Q4, typically a strong period for broker-driven group market sales, which have been more resilient to remote conditions.\nWe're set to finalize our acquisition of Zurich's Group Benefits business, expanding our distribution reach to brokers and large employers.\nTo strengthen Aflac's position, we're balancing growth investments with long-term cost reductions.\nWe offered a generous voluntary separation package, resulting in a 9% reduction in US and corporate workforce, with expected one-time expenses of $45 million in Q4.\nWe launched a US initiative promoting wellness benefits to policyholders, reminding them of coverage for routine medical visits and COVID-19 testing.\nThis campaign and the separation program may create short-term profit margin pressures but should benefit us in 2021.\nWe're committed to meeting customers where they prefer to purchase insurance, which now includes accelerating investments in virtual sales tools for both Japan and US markets.\nWe maintain a strong focus on prudent liquidity and capital management, including robust capital ratios and strategic capital allocation.\nWe're proud of our 38-year track record of dividend growth, supported by our strong capital position and cash flows.\nWe repurchased $400 million of shares in Q3, maintaining a tactical approach to buybacks.\nWe're working to integrate our growth investments to emerge stronger from this period.\nOur goal is to achieve our earnings per share targets while fulfilling our commitments to policyholders.\nWe look forward to discussing our strategic growth plans and efficiency initiatives at the upcoming Financial Analyst Briefing.\nJapan has reported about 97,000 COVID-19 cases and 1,730 deaths.\nAflac Japan's COVID-19 impact includes 1,750 unique claimants with incurred claims of approximately JPY550 million in Q3 and JPY760 million year-to-date.\nThese figures are well below our stress test assumptions, with minimal impact from COVID-19 claims.\nHowever, reduced sales and delayed product launches are pressuring revenue, partially offset by improved persistency.\nThe quarter saw COVID-related expenses of 1.7 billion yen, which included implementing virtual distribution tools, providing employee teller equipment, and supporting distribution\nThe situation in the United States is understandably more intricate\nCOVID-19 cases in the US have surpassed 8.5 million, with fatalities approaching 230,000\nBy the end of Q3, there were 12,800 COVID-19 claimants in the US, with incurred claims of about $23 million for the quarter and $57 million year-to-date\nWe're carefully observing the recent infection surge, but continue to see hospitalization rates, hospital stays, and ICU transitions below our projections\nWe attribute this to improved treatments and the generally younger, healthier workforce among policyholders\nAs Dan mentioned, we initiated a campaign early in Q3 to remind policyholders of their wellness benefits, leading to increased usage\nThis effort involved reaching out to 2.7 million accident and hospital policyholders through email and direct mail in August\nThis affected our benefit ratio for the period but aims to reinforce our products' value proposition\nWe've seen minimal impact on persistency so far, but believe this is partly due to state executive orders mandating premium grace periods\nThese executive orders remained in effect in 13 states at the quarter's end\nIn states where executive orders have expired, we've mitigated lapse rates through proactive outreach to policyholders and employers, converting policyholders from payroll deduction to direct billing, and notifying them of wellness benefits\nRegarding key operational initiatives in Japan and the US, we're balancing growth investments while addressing our expense structure\nA significant factor in elevated expense ratios in Japan and the US is revenue weakness, necessitating a balanced approach\nIn Japan, we're set to introduce a simplified cancer rider in Q4 and launch our updated medical product in Q1 2021\nImplemented in late October, we have the technology to shift from face-to-face to virtual sales and offer a completely digital customer experience\nWe continue direct mail campaigns enhanced by data analytics to improve close rates\nWe anticipate that product development, pandemic recovery, and our alliance with Japan Post will be crucial growth drivers as we progress through 2021\nWe view the pandemic as a catalyst for accelerating investment in our digital roadmap and related process improvements\nIn our Q2 call, I mentioned our paperless initiative across all Japanese operations\nThis is a three-year, roughly 10 billion yen investment, with about 2 billion yen spent in Q3 and another 3.6 billion yen estimated for Q4\nWhile increasing our 2020 expenses, this effort will reduce paper production and circulation by 80 million pieces annually, with projected annual savings of around 3 billion yen\nMoving into Q4, we've budgeted a general and administrative expense increase of approximately 6 billion yen over Q3\nThis includes 50% of our 2020 annual advertising spend, concentrated in the quarter to raise awareness of new products, as well as increased investment in the paperless initiative\nWe're effectively accelerating investments in our digital platform into 2020 and 2021\nIn the US, the development of network, dental, and vision coverage is progressing as planned\nWe've successfully filed our new network products in 48 states, with approvals received in 37\nWe're operational with sales in 10 states and expect to expand this as we enter 2021\nOur consumer markets platform remains on schedule, with hospital accident and cancer product filings expected to be completed in early 2021\nWe also plan to include life insurance in 2021, recognizing it as a natural product for digital sales, leveraging the Aflac brand\nLastly, we'll soon finalize our Zurich Benefits acquisition, having obtained the necessary regulatory approvals\nAlong with efforts to improve overall persistency, these are the three main drivers of earned premium growth in the coming years\nAnticipating further pressure on near-term earned premiums as we enter 2021, we're addressing US expenses urgently\nWe're tackling expenses across two horizons\nHorizon one focuses on the near term and includes a series of 2020 actions designed to reduce annualized run-rate expenses by approximately $100 million as we enter 2021\nThis encompasses both the US platform and corporate expenses\nEarly in Q4, we completed a voluntary separation plan for eligible employees, resulting in a 9% reduction in our US workforce\nWe expect to record a one-time separation expense of about $45 million in Q4 and realize annualized run-rate savings of $45-50 million\nHorizon two expense initiatives increase near-term expenses until the investment is complete, legacy platforms are decommissioned, and business processes are adjusted\nThe most significant investment is in our group business, migrating from an old administrative platform to a new one\nAdditionally, we're completing a broader digital roadmap, which includes about $25 million of accelerated investment in 2020, much of it coming in Q4\nAs mentioned, we need to balance these expense initiatives with growth investment\nWe've adopted a buy-to-build acquisition strategy\nWhile a tactical and prudent use of excess capital, this is not inexpensive in the early years\nThese build efforts include dental and vision, direct-to-consumer, and Group benefits, which collectively impacted our Q3 expense ratio by 110 basis points and are expected to impact Q4 by approximately 160 basis points\nI'll conclude with investment conditions\nOur global investment team remains focused on asset quality, monitoring economic conditions, and sourcing new investment opportunities in a low-interest-rate environment\nWe firmly believe we'll experience a check mark-shaped recovery, meaning a slow road to recovery with pockets of volatility along the way\nOur pre-pandemic actions to tactically improve our portfolio's risk profile, combined with some additional de-risking earlier this year, have served us well, resulting in only modest losses on security sales, impairments, and loss reserve increases\nThese actions have also positioned the portfolio defensively, should a second virus surge impact economic conditions\nWe continue to closely monitor our middle market loan and transitional real estate portfolios\nWhile we've seen credit rating downgrades, our middle market loan portfolio is more resilient, consisting of first-lien loans to high-quality borrowers backed by strong equity sponsors\nOur transitional real estate portfolio also consists of only first-lien positions and is diversified with strong loan-to-value ratios\nWe continue to explore ways to optimize currency hedging\nOverall, there's no material change, but we're further refining our approach to managing unhedged dollars in Japan\nThese unhedged dollars provide diversification and income benefits while lowering our enterprise exposure to the Yen\nLooking towards 2021, we'll reset 2020 hedges on our floating rate portfolio and currency hedges at significantly lower rates\nWhile we don't anticipate this significantly impacting net investment income, you'll see line item impacts on Japan's net investment income, hedge costs, and corporate investment income\nTo conclude, we are maintaining crucial investments for long-term growth and efficiency despite what we believe are temporary declines in sales and earned premiums.\nWe will provide more information about this at our upcoming Annual Financial Investor Conference, including details on investments and when we expect them to start positively impacting growth and profits.\nI will now hand over to Max to provide a more detailed analysis of our financial performance.\nI'll begin by reviewing our third quarter results, focusing on the development of our core capital and earnings drivers.\nIn the third quarter, adjusted earnings per share grew by 19.8% to $1.39, with foreign exchange having no significant impact.\nAdjusted book value per share, including foreign currency translation gains and losses, increased by 17.4%, and the adjusted return on equity, excluding foreign currency impact, was a robust 16.8%, significantly higher than our cost of capital.\nThis quarter was notably affected by the release of favorable US tax regulations concerning the use of foreign tax credits.\nAs a reminder, for US tax purposes, our Japanese subsidiary is treated as a US domestic company.\nWe recognized a cumulative year-to-date benefit from these regulations in the quarter, which reduced our tax rate on adjusted earnings to 4.1%, providing a $0.28 benefit compared to our previous rate.\nOur quarterly tax rate was further reduced by tax credits from our solar and historic rehabilitation investments, which lowered our tax expense by about $20 million more than usual.\nAdditionally, variable investment income exceeded our long-term return expectations by $6 million, and these two factors combined boosted our current quarter earnings per share by approximately $0.03.\nGoing forward, under the current US corporate tax system, we anticipate our tax rate on adjusted earnings to be around 20%.\nShifting focus to our Japan segment.\nTotal earned premium for the quarter decreased by 3.3%, primarily due to first sector policies pay up effects, while earned premium for third sector products declined by 1.7%.\nJapan's revenue trends should be considered in the context of paid-up policy impacts.\nFor instance, year-over-year, earned premium dropped 3.3% in the quarter, while policies in force decreased by slightly less than 1%.\nThis discrepancy obscures the strength of persistency, which has been increasing during the pandemic.\nIn essence, expenses related to managing our in-force business tend to remain stable despite the decline in reported earned premium, putting pressure on our expense ratio.\nJapan's total benefit ratio for the quarter was 71.3%, up 130 basis points year-over-year, and the third sector benefit ratio was 61.7%, up 170 basis points year-over-year.\nThe main reason for the increase was reduced lapses associated with policyholders updating their coverage.\nGiven the current lower new business activity, this naturally elevates our benefit ratio due to lower reserve releases, decreases back amortization, and improves reported persistency.\nWe experienced all of these effects in the third quarter, as evidenced by our persistency improving by 80 basis points year-over-year.\nThe IBNR was also less favorable this quarter.\nWe've observed a decrease in paid claims during the pandemic, particularly in our medical coverages.\nOur IBNR estimate has only partially reflected this decrease due to limited data for making adjustments.\nWe continue to monitor the situation and will adjust our paid data as it becomes more complete.\nFurthermore, for cancer claims older than three years, we extended the completion of claims, resulting in a smaller IBNR release compared to 2019.\nJapan's expense ratio was 21.7%, up 110 basis points year-over-year.\nOur paperless initiative has accelerated as we digitize our operations and improve efficiencies throughout the value chain, aiming for a future state with significantly reduced paper usage.\nOverall, considering COVID-related expenses, promotional spending, and digital and paperless initiatives, we expect Japan's expense ratios to remain elevated around 22% for the rest of 2020.\nNet investment income decreased by 0.2% in yen terms, despite higher variable investment income, as our yen-denominated portfolio generated lower yields due to reduced call income this quarter.\nJapan's pre-tax margin for the quarter was 19.4%, affected by both the higher benefit ratio and increased expense ratio.\nMoving on to US results.\nEarned premium declined by 2.6% due to weaker sales performance.\nPremium persistency improved by 80 basis points to 78.8%, as our efforts to retain accounts and key premium in-force show early positive results.\nAs Fred mentioned, 13 states still had premium grace periods in place at the end of Q3, so we are closely monitoring these developments.\nOur total benefit ratio was 48.3%, which was 80 basis points lower than Q3 2019.\nWe have observed a normalization of claims activity across our portfolio compared to the second quarter.\nTo enhance customer experience and persistency, we conducted an extensive policyholder communication campaign highlighting the embedded wellness benefit in our accident product and encouraged policyholders to use this benefit.\nWe estimate this initiative generated additional claims of about $14 million and impacted our benefit ratio by approximately 100 basis points above normal expectations.\nHowever, we believe our efforts will add value for customers, improve their experience, and enhance long-term persistency.\nThe US expense ratio was 37.3%, up 130 basis points year-over-year.\nThe inclusion of Argus added 80 basis points in the quarter, and the decline in revenues largely explains the remaining year-over-year impact.\nThe effect of declining revenues on our ratios has become more pronounced this quarter compared to previous quarters.\nWe anticipate US expense ratios to remain elevated around 39% for the full year 2020, driven by near-term revenue weakness, an increase in seasonal business activity, and the expected inclusion of the Zurich Group Benefits acquisition.\nUS net investment income decreased by 4.4% due to a 14 basis point contraction in portfolio yield year-over-year.\nUS segment profitability remains healthy at 20.5%, with the low benefit ratio as the primary driver.\nIn our corporate segment, amortized hedge income contributed $22 million on a pre-tax basis to the quarter's earnings, with an ending notional position of $5 billion.\nOur capital position remains strong, ending the quarter with an SMR above 900% in Japan and an RBC of approximately 700% in Aflac Columbus.\nOur RBC is temporarily boosted by delaying statutory subsidiary dividends to Q4.\nWe still expect to end the year with an RBC in the range of 550% to 600%.\nHolding company liquidity stood at $3.8 billion, $1.8 billion above our minimum balance.\nThis is lower compared to earlier in the year but reflects our decision to delay regular Q3 subsidiary dividends to Q4.\nOn an annual basis, we expect uninterrupted dividend flows to continue from our subsidiaries.\nLeverage improved to a comfortable 22.9% due to the increase in shareholders' equity driven by the release of the tax valuation allowance of $1.4 billion.\nWhile we remain cautious in monitoring the pandemic, we are confident in the strength of our capital ratios, excess capital, statutory earnings, dividend capacity, and our ability to navigate current and future stresses brought on by the pandemic or associated economic conditions.\nDuring the quarter, we repurchased $400 million of our own stock and paid dividends of $192 million.\nWe will continue to be flexible and tactical in managing the balance sheet and deploying capital to drive a strong risk-adjusted return on equity with a significant spread to our cost of capital.\nBefore we begin, please limit yourself to one initial question and one related follow-up question to allow other participants an opportunity to ask questions.\nAdrian, we'll now take the first question.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:We're glad you could all join us today to review our Q2 fiscal 2021 results.\nNotably, over two-thirds of our workforce are considered essential, and they've continued to show up daily, allowing us to maintain our service to customers.\nI'm extremely grateful for the efforts of our entire staff.\nConcerning our operations, as mentioned previously, we've observed a stabilization in our commercial volumes and continued robust performance in our government sector.\nAlthough we're still facing challenging and unpredictable circumstances, we're optimistic about the stabilization and the promising vaccine developments, which will not only safeguard our employees but should eventually lead to increased travel and a revival in our commercial markets.\nOur revenue declined by 28% year-on-year from $561 million to $404 million, while our adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations fell by 52% from $0.64 to $0.31.\nSales to our commercial clients decreased by 48%, while those to government and defense customers rose by 13%.\nDuring this quarter, sales to government and defense clients accounted for 52% of our total revenue.\nOur Aviation Services division experienced a 6% growth compared to the first quarter.\nThis increase was due to higher volume in our MRO operations, which typically sees a seasonal uptick in Q2 compared to Q1, as well as the ongoing strength of our government business.\nOur commercial parts volumes remained relatively steady throughout the quarter, staying above the lows experienced in April and May.\nI'm particularly pleased with our progress in improving margins.\nIn recent quarters, we've streamlined our operations across the company, reduced indirect and overhead costs, restructured or terminated several underperforming contracts, and sold off a non-core business that was generating losses.\nThe effects of these actions are now becoming evident in our adjusted operating margins, which saw a significant improvement from 2.5% to 4% sequentially on stable revenue.\nRegarding cash flow, we generated $28 million from continuing operations and decreased our accounts receivable financing program by nearly $7 million, further enhancing our already robust balance sheet and reducing our net leverage to less than 1 times EBITDA.\nWe continue to secure substantial new business opportunities that set us up for future growth.\nOur partnership with Fortress for CFM56 engines ensures a reliable supply to meet the increasing need for used serviceable material on -5B and -7B variants.\nWe anticipate a rise in demand for USM across all sectors as we recover from the pandemic, with particularly high demand for these engine types.\nThe Navy's renewal of our contract to support C-40 aircraft acknowledges our excellent performance over the past five years and expands our responsibilities for the next five-year period.\nIt's significant that this contract was awarded to an incumbent for the first time, highlighting the exceptional quality of our service.\nFurthermore, our decade-long agreement with Honeywell to be the exclusive authorized service center for 737 MAX Electronic Bleed Air System components puts us in a prime position to assist MAX operators globally when the aircraft resumes service.\nThese recent contracts, along with others announced in recent months like the Unison expansion, represent nearly $1.7 billion in total contract value secured this fiscal year so far.\nThis showcases the distinct value of our Aviation Services offerings, and these business successes will contribute to our faster recovery following the economic downturn.\nOur quarterly sales of $403.6 million decreased by 28% or $157.3 million compared to last year, primarily due to the pandemic's impact on commercial air travel.\nComparing to the previous quarter, Aviation Services sales increased by 5.9% or $21.4 million, while Expeditionary Services sales decreased by 50% or $18.6 million.\nThe quarter-to-quarter decline in Expeditionary Services was attributed to two main factors.\nFirstly, the composites business was fully discontinued at the end of Q1, which had generated $7 million in revenue during Q1 but none in the current quarter.\nSecondly, as mentioned before, mobility experienced an exceptionally strong Q1 due to increased pallet shipments.\nWithin Aviation Services, our government and defense sector grew by 19% or $30 million year-over-year, reflecting strong performance on existing contracts.\nDuring both this quarter and Q1, our program to deliver two C-40 aircraft to the U.S. Marine Corps generated substantial revenue due to increased activity.\nThe gross profit margin for the quarter rose to 17.2% from 15.3% in the same quarter last year, primarily due to CARES Act payroll support.\nCompared to the first quarter's 12.1%, the gross profit margin increased, reflecting our efforts to reduce indirect costs and eliminate underperforming contracts and product lines.\nSelling, general, and administrative costs totaled $43.4 million for the three-month period.\nAfter adjustments, SG&A expenses amounted to $38 million, or 9.4% of revenue, which is $13 million less than the same period last year, demonstrating a reduction in our overhead expenses.\nOf this cost reduction, roughly $3.2 million came from temporary cuts in pay and benefits, which were reinstated on December 1.\nRegarding our previous statement, we have been negotiating with the Justice Department about an investigation into airlift under the False Claims Act.\nWe recorded an additional $6 million accrual in discontinued operations during the quarter, bringing our total reserve for this issue to $8 million based on our most recent settlement proposal.\nOur continuing operations generated $27.6 million in cash from operating activities this quarter.\nThis includes a $6.8 million cash outflow as we continue to shrink our accounts receivable financing program.\nExcluding the accounts receivable financing program, cash flow from continuing operations' operating activities was $34.4 million.\nThe value of inventory decreased by $12.7 million over the quarter.\nOur net debt at the end of the quarter stood at $112.1 million, a reduction of $37 million from $149.3 million at the close of Q1.\nOur financial position and liquidity remain robust with a net leverage of 0.95 times adjusted EBITDA, $110 million in unrestricted cash, and about $390 million in unused capacity on our revolving credit facility.\nConsequently, we are in a strong position to fund what we anticipate will be unique opportunities for business growth in the upcoming quarters.\nGenerally, we are satisfied with our performance given the current circumstances and pleased with the improvements we've made in operational efficiency.\nAs I mentioned earlier, we are encouraged by the various vaccines entering the market and the plans for their distribution for several reasons.\nWe anticipate that as vaccines are distributed and infection rates decline, travel restrictions will be eased and air travel will resume.\nUntil that time, we expect revenue to remain relatively stable, and we will maintain our focus on generating cash flow and improving profit margins.\nWe will also continue to concentrate on securing new business opportunities, and I'm confident that our strong financial position, coupled with airlines' growing interest in our cost-effective value-added services, will lead to even more growth prospects.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:These documents can be found in the Investor Relations portion of applied.com.\nThe call will employ non-GAAP financial metrics, which are subject to the qualifications mentioned in those documents.\nWe at Applied wish you and your loved ones good health, safety, and resilience during these times.\nI'll begin with an update on our business, including our ongoing pandemic response, progress on internal projects, and insights into the external environment.\nDave will then present our financial results, specifics about our first quarter, and our outlook, after which I'll conclude with some final remarks.\nAs we enter early fiscal 2021, we're witnessing a slight upturn gaining traction and performing well.\nThe year's beginning is promising, and I believe we're well-positioned to build upon this positive momentum moving forward.\nOur operations are running efficiently.\nOur supply chain and stock levels are in good shape, and we're effectively meeting customers' growing needs as an initial demand recovery seems to be taking place.\nOver the past few quarters, we've swiftly adapted to the changing landscape, implementing new procedures and methods to support our customers' requirements.\nA crucial aspect of our message to all stakeholders during these changing times is how Applied is more robust now than in previous cycles.\nThis includes advantages from our expanded offerings, increased technical focus, and a more diverse end market mix.\nWe've also enhanced our marketing and sales efforts to highlight our comprehensive and leading technical offerings and to further develop our cross-selling opportunities.\nWe are increasingly vital to our customers as maintenance, production, and efficiency requirements begin to increase across their core operational infrastructure.\nThese factors are providing near-term sales support and make us increasingly optimistic about our growth potential going forward.\nFurthermore, investments in systems, talent, analytics, and operational processes in recent years are yielding additional benefits in the current climate.\nWe swiftly adjusted our cost structure and are once again demonstrating our operational discipline and the resilience of our business model.\nThis is evidenced by better-than-expected decremental margins in the quarter and ongoing strengthening of our balance sheet following strong cash generation performance and a nearly 30% reduction in net debt levels compared to the previous year.\nOur capabilities and company-specific opportunities, combined with the improving outlook, position us to be a growth leader with increasing earnings potential as we enter the next phase of recovery in the industrial economy.\nThis is demonstrated by our recent acquisition of Advanced Control Solutions earlier this month.\nACS represents the next step in expanding our automation offering, further differentiating our value proposition, diversifying our end market mix, and enhancing our growth profile to include next-generation industrial solutions.\nRegarding the broader demand environment, underlying trends remained below prior year levels during our first quarter as business activity continued to adjust to the ongoing pandemic.\nHowever, customer order activity improved sequentially throughout the quarter, and we continue to gain traction with our internal growth initiatives.\nAs a result, the year-over-year organic sales decline of 13.4% in the quarter improved significantly from the 18.4% decline in the previous quarter.\nYear-over-year organic sales declines improved each month, and sequential trends in daily sales rates were seasonally strong.\nWe're beginning to see increased maintenance activity and break/fix requirements as customers allow greater access to their facilities and expand equipment utilization while production gradually ramps up, including at smaller local accounts.\nFeedback from our sales leaders suggests order sizes are increasing, customer inventory levels are being replenished, and maintenance projects are being authorized as businesses increase activity and new safety protocols support a productive path forward.\nAdditionally, we saw several industry verticals return to growth during the quarter, with 10 of our top 30 verticals showing year-over-year increases compared to only two in the previous quarter.\nSectors such as Food & Beverage, Aggregates, Technology, Chemicals, and Transportation all demonstrated positive momentum.\nWhile weakness remains most pronounced in heavy industries like Machinery, Metals, and Oil & Gas, demand within these verticals appears to be stabilizing and showing slight improvement.\nWe view these dynamics as a positive sign for the industrial economy and demand for our critical products and solutions.\nNevertheless, the pace of end market improvement remains gradual and at times inconsistent.\nOrganic sales through our first 18 business days of October are down by mid-teens percent compared to the prior year.\nWe experienced some softening in sales early in the month following a strong end to our fiscal first quarter.\nSales trends have improved each week in October, with order momentum increasing sequentially across both our segments month-to-date.\nNonetheless, it's crucial to recognize that visibility remains restricted as we approach the typically slower winter season, with customers continuing to navigate an uncertain economic and pandemic landscape in the short term\nCustomer purchasing behavior may be more conservative around election periods\nAs demonstrated in recent quarters, we are adept at managing and performing in this uncertain business climate and will maintain a cautious approach to costs and capital allocation in the near future while concentrating on our internal growth prospects\nIn general, we're observing indications that support our belief that the worst has passed, and a recovery is beginning to take hold\nThis is promising as we enter the traditionally stronger second half of our fiscal year, when comparisons become more favorable and we continue to implement our internal growth strategies\nAs a reminder, a supplementary investor presentation summarizing key financial performance and discussion points is accessible on our investor website for your reference\nTo elaborate on our first quarter results, total sales decreased by 12.7% compared to the same quarter last year\nAcquisitions contributed 1.1% growth, which was partially counteracted by an unfavorable foreign currency impact of 0.4%\nAfter accounting for these factors, sales declined by 13.4% on an organic basis, with an equal number of selling days year-over-year\nRegarding sales performance by segment, as shown on slides six and seven\nSales in our Service Center segment decreased by 14.9% year-over-year, or 14.4% on an organic basis\nThe decline reflects the ongoing impact of COVID-19, including reduced industrial production activity and customer facility restrictions, which continues to affect MRO demand across our service center network\nHowever, the 14% organic decline year-over-year shows an improvement from the 21% decline in the previous quarter\nFurthermore, average daily sales rates increased by more than 4% sequentially, surpassing the normal seasonal progression\nAs Neil mentioned, we observed increased maintenance activity and break/fix demand\nMore customers are granting access to their facilities and releasing working capital spending following a slow period during the summer months\nYear-over-year declines remain most significant in the Metals, Oil & Gas, and Machinery end markets, but were offset by underlying improvements in Food & Beverage, Pulp & Paper, Aggregates, Forestry, and Chemical Industries, as well as continued growth in our Australian operations\nIn our Fluid Power & Flow Control segment, sales decreased by 7.4% compared to the same quarter last year, with our August 2019 acquisition of Olympus Controls contributing 3.8 points of growth on approximately half a quarter of remaining inorganic contribution\nOn an organic basis, segment sales declined by 11.2%, reflecting lower demand across Industrial, Off-Highway Mobile, and process-related end markets\nThis was partially offset by sales growth in Technology, Life Sciences, Food & Beverage, and Chemical end markets during the quarter, as well as ongoing progress with our cross-selling initiatives and strong sales activity across our emerging automation platform\nRegarding margin performance, as highlighted on Page eight of the presentation, gross margin of 28.9% decreased by approximately 50 basis points year-over-year, or 40 basis points when excluding noncash LIFO expense of $1.1 million in the quarter and $0.4 million in the prior year quarter\nYear-over-year declines primarily reflect unfavorable mix tied to sales declines across our local service center accounts, although more modest relative to last quarter, as well as more subdued pricing opportunities given the softer demand environment\nNevertheless, on a sequential basis, gross margins improved by 13 basis points, or 17 basis points when excluding LIFO expense, and were slightly ahead of our expectations\nWhile we anticipate some of the volume-driven year-over-year headwinds to persist in the near term, we remain focused on driving annual gross margin expansion as demand levels normalize, reflecting benefits from our systems investments, the positive contribution of expansionary products, strategic growth driven by our technical service-oriented solutions, and initiatives to expand business across our local customer base\nAdditionally, we are beginning to observe a slightly higher level of supplier price increase announcements, which, combined with firming demand, could provide some positive momentum for pricing contribution and margin expansion into the second half of our fiscal year\nRegarding our operating costs, selling, distribution, and administrative expenses decreased by 13.4% year-over-year, or approximately 15% when excluding incremental operating costs associated with our Olympus Controls acquisition\nBoth of these figures exclude $1.5 million of nonroutine costs in the prior year quarter\nThe year-over-year decline reflects the ongoing benefit from various actions we've taken in recent quarters to align expenses with lower demand\nThis includes a mix of both structural and temporary cost actions as we continue to assess the environment\nWhile we have begun to roll back some of the temporary actions, our team continues to demonstrate great discipline in controlling costs and identifying internal opportunities\nCombined with improving sales trends during the quarter, we reported a 9.5% decremental margin on operating income during our recent fiscal first quarter, which exceeded our expectations and highlights the adaptability and durability of our operating model\nMoving forward, we will remain prudent and disciplined in maintaining our cost structure as we continue to gradually roll off temporary cost actions to align with our recent performance, a more constructive outlook, and our growth initiatives\nEBITDA for the quarter was $67.6 million, down 13.6% compared to adjusted EBITDA of $78.2 million in the prior year quarter, while EBITDA margin was 9%, down a modest 10 basis points over the prior year despite the double-digit sales decline\nWe reported net income of $34.8 million or $0.89 per share, down from adjusted net income of $39.9 million or $1.02 per share in the prior year quarter\nShifting our focus to cash flow performance and liquidity.\nIn Q1, operations generated $81.8 million in cash, with free cash flow at $78.2 million, equating to roughly 225% of net income.\nThese figures increased from $50 million and $45 million respectively compared to the same quarter last year, marking a record Q1 for cash generation.\nThe quarter's robust cash performance reflects ongoing benefits from our working capital strategies and the countercyclical nature of our business model's cash profile.\nDue to strong cash flow in the quarter, we concluded September with over $271 million in cash, approximately 75% of which was unrestricted and held in the U.S.\nNotably, this is after using $62 million in cash to reduce debt during the quarter.\nSince early 2018, we've reduced our debt by over $200 million, including more than $80 million in the past year.\nOur net debt has decreased by nearly 30% year-over-year, and our net leverage was 2.1 times adjusted EBITDA at quarter's end, lower than the previous year's 2.3 times and the year before at 2.6 times.\nFurthermore, our credit line remains unused with about $250 million available and an additional $250 million Accordion option.\nCombined with extra capacity on our uncommitted private shelf facility, we have ample liquidity and a strong balance sheet as we enter what seems to be a recovering market.\nThis financial flexibility allows us to fund increased working capital needs in upcoming quarters as customer demand improves and to pursue strategic acquisitions aligned with our growth plans when opportunities arise.\nOur immediate acquisition strategy focuses on smaller, complementary targets that align with our growth priorities, particularly in automation and fluid power sectors.\nNow, let's discuss our future outlook.\nThere's limited visibility on how customers will operate during the traditionally slower winter months.\nHowever, to provide some near-term guidance based on October trends and assuming normal seasonal patterns in daily sales rates for the rest of the quarter, we anticipate fiscal Q2 2021 sales to decrease 13% to 14% organically year-over-year.\nThis projection includes an assumption of low-teen organic declines in both our Service Center segment and Fluid Power & Flow Control segment.\nThis guidance is intended to provide a starting point for how Q2 sales might develop if trends follow typical seasonality over the next two months.\nIf customers reduce production or extend plant closures, organic declines could exceed the 13% to 14% estimate.\nConversely, if industrial activity continues to improve and our internal growth initiatives gain traction, organic declines could be less severe than the 13% to 14% projection.\nAdditionally, we expect our recent acquisition of ACS to contribute approximately $6 million in sales during our fiscal second quarter.\nBased on the projected 13% to 14% organic sales decline, we believe a low double-digit to low-teen decremental margin is a reasonable expectation for our second quarter.\nThis assumes gross margin will remain relatively stable compared to first quarter levels and accounts for the gradual reversal of temporary cost-cutting measures.\nAs mentioned, we will continue to manage our operating costs carefully, including ongoing focus on internal opportunities and margin initiatives, which we expect to balance our cost trajectory moving forward.\nWe're pleased with our cost and margin performance year-to-date, which provides flexibility to further reverse temporary cost-cutting measures as we take an proactive approach to an emerging recovery and our strategic growth targets.\nWe maintain that an effective tax rate of 23% to 25% is still a reasonable assumption in the near term.\nLastly, regarding cash flow, we anticipate a moderation from first quarter levels for the remainder of the year, given potential increased working capital requirements as we support growth and recovery throughout the year.\nWe remain confident in our cash generation potential over the business cycle and reaffirm our normalized annual free cash target of at least 100% of net income.\nOverall, I'm pleased with our start to the year.\nOur team has demonstrated remarkable resilience over recent quarters, driving improved performance into early fiscal 2021 and positioning us to respond to and capitalize on the ongoing recovery.\nWe've proven our business model's durability, strengthened our financial position, and optimized our cost structure.\nWe're leveraging our unique and differentiated industry position to lead industrial growth in the emerging recovery and in the years ahead.\nThese factors are reflected in our first quarter results and provide further evidence of our positive trajectory.\nFrom our industry-leading technical MRO capabilities to our Engineered Solutions focus, multichannel cross-selling opportunity, and expanding automation platform.\nWe have multiple catalysts to expand our market potential and accelerate market share gains in coming years, while driving additional margin expansion.\nThis aligns with our long-term targets of $4.5 billion in sales and 11% EBITDA margins, which are achievable and provide the framework for accelerating earnings power and long-term stakeholder returns.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO, is present alongside Adam Norwitt, the CEO.\nThe company achieved record-breaking sales of $2,323 million and unprecedented GAAP and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.12 and $1.09 respectively in the third quarter.\nCompared to the same period last year, sales increased by 11% in US dollars and 10% in local currencies.\nThe third quarter saw a 9% organic growth in sales.\nSequentially, there was a 17% increase in sales in US dollars and a 15% rise in both local currencies and organic growth.\nThe interconnect division, accounting for 96% of total sales, grew by 11% in US dollars and 10% in local currencies compared to the same quarter last year.\nThe cable division, making up 4% of total sales, experienced a 2% growth in US dollars and a 5% increase in local currencies compared to the third quarter of the previous year.\nAdam will provide more details on market trends shortly.\nThe third quarter of 2020 saw an operating income of $476 million.\nOperating margins reached 20.5%, showing a significant sequential increase of 250 basis points and an 80 basis point improvement compared to the same period last year.\nThe substantial sequential margin improvement was due to efficient conversion of higher sales and an anticipated significant reduction in COVID-related expenses.\nThe year-over-year margin improvement was attributed to effective conversion of increased sales.\nIn the interconnect segment, third quarter 2020 margins were 22.4%, up from 21.7% in the same quarter of 2019 and 20% in the second quarter of 2020.\nThe cable segment saw margins of 10.7% in the third quarter of 2020, an increase from 10.2% in the same period of 2019 and 9.4% in the second quarter of 2020.\nWe are extremely proud of our performance this quarter, given the unprecedented challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOur team's ability to navigate the impacts of this crisis is a direct result of our company's entrepreneurial management team's strength and dedication, which continues to foster a high-performance, action-oriented culture, enabling us to seize opportunities and maximize profitability in an uncertain market environment.\nThe quarter's interest expense was $28 million, down from $30 million in the same quarter of the previous year.\nThe company's GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2020, including an $11 million excess tax benefit from stock option exercises, was 22.1%, compared to 24.5% in the third quarter of 2019.\nExcluding the mentioned excess tax benefit, the company's adjusted effective tax rate remained at 24.5% for both the third quarters of 2020 and 2019.\nThe adjusted net income of $336 million represented 14% of sales in the third quarter of 2020, further confirming the company's strong financial performance.\nOn a GAAP basis, diluted earnings per share grew by 22% to $1.12 in the third quarter of 2020, up from $0.92 in the same period of 2019.\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share increased by 15% to $1.09 in the third quarter of 2020, compared to $0.95 in the third quarter of 2019.\nOrders for the quarter totaled $2,275 million, a 9% increase compared to the third quarter of 2019 and a 15% sequential rise, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 0.98 to 1.\nThe company continues to demonstrate excellent cash generation abilities.\nThe third quarter saw strong cash flow from operations of $398 million, or 119% of adjusted net income.\nOur free cash flow was $330 million, equivalent to 98% of adjusted net income.\nAt the end of September, inventory, accounts receivable, and accounts payable stood at $1.4 billion, $1.9 billion, and $1.1 billion respectively.\nInventory days, days sales outstanding, and payable days were 79, 72, and 61 days respectively, all showing improvement from the second quarter and falling within our normal range.\nDuring the third quarter, our $398 million cash flow from operations, along with $104 million from stock option exercises, were primarily used to repurchase 1.9 million company shares for $202 million (average price of $108), pay $75 million in dividends, fund $68 million in net capital expenditures, finance $50 million in acquisitions, and make $9 million in net short-term investments.\nThis increase will take effect for payments starting in January 2021.\nAs of September 30, cash and short-term investments totaled $1.5 billion, with the majority held outside the US.\nTotal debt as of September 30 was $3.8 billion, with no maturities due before the third quarter of 2021.\nNet debt as of September 30 stood at $2.4 billion.\nAt the end of the quarter, total cash on hand plus remaining credit facility availability amounted to $4 billion.\nThird quarter EBITDA was $568 million, and our pro forma net leverage ratio was 1.2 times.\nFirst and foremost, I hope that everyone on this call, along with your families, friends, and colleagues, is staying safe and healthy during the pandemic.\nAs Craig mentioned, I will highlight some of our third quarter achievements and, more importantly, discuss trends and progress across our served markets.\nI will then comment on our outlook for the fourth quarter and the full year 2020.\nRegarding the third quarter, in what has clearly been an unprecedented and volatile year, I'm truly proud that Amphenol achieved record sales and adjusted earnings per share, significantly surpassing the guidance we provided just 90 days ago.\nSales reached $2,323 million, representing an 11% increase in US dollars, 10% in local currencies, and 9% organic growth compared to the previous year.\nThis strong growth was driven by increases in mobile devices, IT-datacom, industrial, military, broadband, and automotive markets, partially offset by declines in commercial air and mobile networks markets.\nWe are particularly proud of achieving a robust 17% sequential growth from the second quarter, significantly exceeding our original expectations.\nAs Craig mentioned, the company received $2,275 million in orders, representing a book-to-bill ratio of 0.98 to 1.\nDespite ongoing pandemic-related operational challenges, we achieved excellent third quarter operating margins of 20.5%, a significant 250 basis point improvement from the second quarter.\nThe company's financial position remains robust, with operating cash flow reaching $398 million, particularly noteworthy given the stronger-than-expected sequential growth from the previous quarter.\nWe continue to utilize our financial strength to benefit shareholders through stock repurchases and a 16% increase in our quarterly dividend, as announced today.\nI'm immensely proud of the Amphenol team's accomplishments.\nThe record results this quarter undoubtedly demonstrate the value of our entrepreneurial organization's agility, discipline, and drive.\nRegarding trends in our served markets, Amphenol's balanced and diverse end market presence proves to be an invaluable asset, especially during times of economic uncertainty.\nAs many markets began recovering in the third quarter, we swiftly capitalized on growth opportunities while maintaining our broad exposure to new developments across the electronics industry.\nThe military sector accounted for 12% of our third quarter sales.\nThis market's sales grew by 6% year-over-year, primarily driven by increases in military vehicles, naval, space, communications, and airframe applications.\nOur sales increased sequentially by a robust 30% as we rebounded from the impact of production restrictions at certain facilities due to government-imposed COVID-19 control measures in the second quarter.\nWe anticipate a slight increase in sales for the fourth quarter compared to current levels.\nFor the full year 2020, we project a low-single digit sales increase compared to the previous year.\nThis annual performance reflects our strong market position and execution, partially offset by pandemic-related production constraints experienced in the first half of 2020.\nI'm very impressed with our global military market team's efforts.\nThey've maintained unwavering focus on ensuring our defense industry clients have uninterrupted access to our cutting-edge interconnect products, which are vital to our customers' equipment.\nWe're encouraged by both the accelerating adoption of electronics in these systems and the generally favorable defense spending environment.\nOur investments in new technologies and large-scale production capabilities over recent years have positioned us well to capitalize on these trends for the foreseeable future.\nThe commercial aerospace sector represented 2% of our third quarter sales.\nSales declined by a significant 40% as the commercial aircraft market again experienced unprecedented demand reductions for new aircraft due to pandemic-related disruptions in the global travel industry.\nSequentially, our sales performed slightly better than expected, increasing 4% from the second quarter.\nLooking ahead, we anticipate the commercial air market will continue to be negatively impacted by the substantial reduction in global air travel demand.\nConsequently, we expect an approximate 20% sequential decrease in our sales to this market in the fourth quarter.\nFor the full year 2020, we project a roughly 35% decline from the previous year due to the unprecedented demand disruptions our customers are experiencing.\nUndoubtedly, these are challenging times for the entire travel industry, severely impacting the near-term commercial airplane market.\nNonetheless, our team remains committed to leveraging the Company's strong technological position across various aircraft platforms and next-generation systems integrated into those planes.\nWe remain well-positioned for when this market eventually returns to growth.\nThe industrial market accounted for 22% of our quarterly sales.\nOur industrial market sales surpassed expectations, growing by 21% in US dollars and 18% organically, a very strong performance.\nThis robust growth was particularly driven by the instrumentation, medical, industrial battery, heavy equipment, alternative energy, and rail mass transit segments, reflecting broad-based growth in the industrial market.\nAlthough we had anticipated slightly lower sales compared to the second quarter, we actually achieved 11% sequential growth in the third quarter, a very strong performance.\nFor the fourth quarter, we expect a slight decline from these third quarter sales levels.\nNevertheless, for the full year 2020, we project a low-double digit sales increase from 2019 levels, an outstanding performance given the overall market conditions.\nI'm truly proud of our industrial market team's efforts.\nWhether facilitating growth in various medical equipment volumes, managing significant demand increases for semiconductor capital equipment, or executing on unprecedented demand for next-generation batteries, our global organization has quickly adapted to fully support our worldwide customers, despite numerous operational challenges arising throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.\nLooking long-term, I'm confident that our performance during this crisis has positioned us very strongly for the future.\nImportantly, we continue to lead the development of next-generation interconnect, sensor, and antenna products to support our industrial market customers, who are accelerating their adoption of cutting-edge technologies.\nThe automotive sector represented 17% of our third quarter sales.\nFollowing a truly challenging second quarter where the global automotive industry was severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, we were pleased to see a strong recovery in the third quarter, with results significantly better than initially anticipated.\nOur team's outstanding execution led to a year-over-year sales increase of 4% in US dollars and 1% organically, surpassing our expectations.\nSequentially, our sales grew by a remarkable 78% from the second quarter as our team swiftly capitalized on recovering demand from automotive customers across all regions.\nLooking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect automotive sales to further increase in the mid-single digits from these levels.\nFor the full year 2020, we anticipate a low-double digit sales reduction, reflecting the severe and sudden pandemic-related downturn in demand from automotive OEMs observed in the first half.\nI'm extremely proud of our automotive market team, who has clearly demonstrated both agility and resilience in achieving these strong sequential growth levels.\nIn fact, our performance through this crisis strengthens my confidence in our long-term prospects in the automotive market.\nWe have consistently broadened our selection of interconnect, sensor, and antenna products through internal development and acquisitions, aiming to support a diverse range of onboard electronics in various vehicles produced by global automakers.\nThis ongoing approach is likely to continue providing advantages as the automotive industry recovers.\nMobile devices accounted for 16% of our quarterly sales.\nOur sales to mobile device customers grew by an impressive 25% compared to last year, primarily due to increased sales of products used in laptops, tablets, and wearables, partially offset by slightly lower smartphone sales.\nOur sales increased by a remarkable 37% compared to the previous quarter.\nThis growth was driven by higher sales across all product categories we serve.\nWe anticipate a slight increase from these already strong third quarter levels in the fourth quarter.\nFor the entire year, we expect sales to grow in the low double digits compared to 2019.\nIt's worth noting that this performance significantly exceeds our initial expectations before the pandemic hit.\nAlthough mobile devices remain one of our most volatile markets, our exceptional and adaptable team is ready to seize any opportunities for additional sales that may arise in the fourth quarter or beyond.\nOur leading range of antennas, interconnect products, and mechanisms continues to support a wide variety of next-generation mobile devices, positioning us well for the future.\nThe mobile networks market represented 6% of our quarterly sales.\nSales decreased as expected, dropping 19% in US dollars and 21% organically compared to last year, due to lower sales to wireless operators and continued impact from US government restrictions on certain Chinese entities.\nWe expect a further seasonal sales reduction of about 25% in the fourth quarter, affecting both OEMs and service providers.\nFor the full year, we anticipate a high-teens reduction in sales, reflecting the impact of US government restrictions and the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDespite short-term challenges in the mobile networks market, we remain confident in our long-term position in this important and dynamic industry.\nOur team continues to work diligently to expand our opportunities with next-generation equipment and networks.\nAs customers increase investment in these advanced systems, we look forward to benefiting from the increased potential that comes from our unique position with both equipment manufacturers and mobile service providers worldwide.\nThe information technology and data communications market accounted for 21% of our quarterly sales.\nThird-quarter sales once again exceeded our expectations, increasing by a robust 24% in US dollars and 21% organically compared to last year.\nThis growth was driven by increased demand for data traffic, prompting both OEM and service provider customers to increase their demand across nearly all segments of the IT-datacom market.\nSequentially, sales decreased by less than expected, dropping 10% from our exceptionally strong second quarter.\nLooking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect a mid-teens sequential decline from these very strong third-quarter levels.\nFor the full year 2020, we anticipate sales to increase in the low teens, reflecting the significant upside in demand we experienced in both the second and third quarters, partially offset by pandemic-related disruptions in the first quarter.\nOur team supporting the IT-datacom market has clearly distinguished itself this year, quickly capitalizing on unprecedented demand for our industry-leading high-speed and power products.\nSimultaneously, we've maintained our efforts to further develop our wide range of industry-leading interconnect products for data communications networks worldwide.\nWe remain very encouraged by our strong technology position in the global IT-datacom market.\nOur customers continue to push their equipment to higher performance levels to manage the dramatic increases in bandwidth and processor power demand.\nIn response, our team remains focused on enabling this ongoing revolution in IT-datacom.\nThe broadband market represented 4% of our quarterly sales.\nSales increased by 5% compared to last year, driven by stronger demand for home installation-related equipment from broadband operators.\nSequentially, sales increased by a stronger-than-expected 13% as our customers continued to upgrade their networks to support increased demand for high-speed data.\nWe expect sales in the fourth quarter to moderate from these levels due to typical end-of-year seasonality.\nFor the full year 2020, we anticipate sales to be roughly flat compared to the previous year.\nThis reflects pandemic-related disruptions in certain regions, offset by increased customer investments to support higher bandwidth demand.\nLooking ahead, while our third-quarter performance was very strong, significant uncertainties remain in the global market due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which appears to be worsening in some parts of the world.\nAssuming no new major disruptions from the pandemic and constant exchange rates, we expect fourth-quarter sales between $2,160 million and $2,200 million, with adjusted diluted earnings per share between $0.98 and $1.00.\nThis represents both sales and adjusted diluted earnings per share growth of flat to 2% compared to last year.\nOur fourth-quarter guidance also implies full-year sales of $8,333 million to $8,373 million and full-year adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.59 to $3.61.\nThis outlook represents sales growth of 1% to 2% compared to last year and an adjusted diluted earnings per share decline of 3% to 4%.\nThe expected decrease in earnings is directly related to the significant costs and disruptions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic that the company faced, particularly during the first half of 2020.\nI'm extremely pleased with Amphenol's third-quarter performance, especially our team's achievement of new quarterly records in both sales and earnings.\nMost importantly, I remain very confident in our outstanding management team's ability to adapt to ongoing market challenges and capitalize on future opportunities to grow our market position and improve profitability.\nI want to assure you that our entire organization remains committed to securing the company's financial performance while wholeheartedly dedicating ourselves to protecting the safety and health of each of our employees worldwide.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Our website is broadcasting the current discussion.\nBob Wetherbee, Board Chair, President and CEO, and Don Newman, Senior Vice President and CFO, are joining today's call.\nWhile focusing on second quarter highlights and key messages, Bob and Don may reference certain slides in their comments.\nThese slides can be found on our website.\nThe slides offer additional information and details about our results and outlook.\nIt's been over a year since the COVID-19 pandemic caused a global lockdown.\nThe past four quarters have seen numerous changes, and it's tempting to concentrate on the more difficult aspects of this time.\nHowever, it's crucial to recognize that we also made positive changes to things within our control.\nWe quickly adapted our digital technology infrastructure to excel in remote collaboration, like many others.\nTechnology enabled us to optimize our processes and work more productively overall.\nWe plan to continue enhancing these improvements by using new skills and tools to offer more flexibility to our employees and build stronger connections with our customers, while also realizing the related structural cost savings.\nI'm happy to see many people traveling by air again for the summer season.\nEach day brings new signs of recovery in airframe and jet engine demand.\nThe current economic revival, from travel to consumer goods to energy, is genuine.\nDespite ongoing pandemic-related uncertainties, I'm sure the desire to travel is strong and increasing worldwide.\nThis ultimately sustains the long backlog for commercial airliner programs.\nATI is prepared to meet our customers' production needs.\nGiven this context, our second quarter financial results demonstrate the improving trends in our end markets.\nHowever, they also reflect the negative impact of the recent strike by the United Steelworkers at our Specialty Rolled Products (SRP) business.\nExcluding the $40 million cost attributed to the strike and a minor adjustment to our restructuring reserves, we experienced a loss of $0.12 per share in the second quarter.\nDespite the earnings loss, the aerospace recovery is clearly evident in the underlying numbers.\nOur jet engine product revenues increased by over 20% compared to the first quarter of 2021.\nThe High Performance Materials & Components (HPMC) segment saw its margins improve by more than 200 basis points sequentially and nearly 300 basis points year-over-year.\nDon will provide more detailed information on this positive news shortly.\nAs mentioned in our April first quarter earnings call, we were extremely disappointed that the union leadership decided to call a strike at our major SRP operating locations.\nOur comprehensive continuity plans allowed us to maintain operations during the strike.\nThe new 4-year labor agreement was approved on July 13.\nMany represented employees resumed their positions within a week of ratification.\nWe are safely and efficiently ramping up operations to their previous production levels.\nWe are on schedule and expect to return to full production capabilities in September.\nMany people inside and outside of ATI have asked me some version of the question, \"Was the strike worth it?\"\nCertainly, we would have preferred to continue negotiations to reach an agreement without a work stoppage.\nA competitive cost structure for this business is crucial.\nIf left unresolved, we would have faced rapidly escalating healthcare costs that were projected to double every seven years.\nProduct pricing cannot increase fast enough to offset that level of healthcare inflation.\nThe SRP business would have fallen behind its competitors.\nWe were compelled to find a solution now.\nUnder this contract, annual healthcare cost inflation will be limited to 3.5%.\nThe represented employees are responsible for taking any necessary actions to cover annual overage amounts.\nThe SRP business is now appropriately focused on returning to full speed and providing our customers with the materials and components they need.\nTo conclude my comments about the SRP business, I have two pieces of good news to share.\nFirstly, the transformation initiative to discontinue standard stainless sheet products is progressing as planned and will be completed by the end of 2021.\nWe are making excellent progress in consolidating our footprint.\nSecondly, we recently entered into a long-term agreement with JSW Steel USA to toll convert a significant percentage of their Ohio-produced carbon steel slabs through our hot rolling and processing facility in Pennsylvania.\nThis multi-year agreement provides a significant opportunity to increase our asset utilization and cash flow.\nWe are pleased to collaborate with JSW to bring the exceptional quality and gauge control of our world-class HRPF to their customers.\nWe are currently increasing production.\nCongratulations to the operating team for setting a production record for carbon steel toll conversion volume in June, even during the strike at this facility.\nWhat are we observing in our key end markets?\nFor the first time in several quarters, the news is positive across most of our portfolio.\nThis excludes the strike impact from the comparison.\nI believe this provides the most accurate view of our underlying performance and true market demand.\nIn this context, sales increased sequentially in each of our major end markets, except for electronics, which is being compared to record results in Q1.\nWe experienced year-over-year sales growth in most of our primary markets, with Energy increasing by 60% and Defense by 22%.\nWe're gaining traction in our biggest key market, commercial jet engines.\nThis is mainly due to the recovery of narrow-body platforms, especially engine programs for A320 and A321 aircraft.\nAs previously mentioned, the demand recovery started in our Forgings business, which has lead times 6-9 months ahead of engine production.\nOur Forgings revenue surpassed both last year's and last quarter's levels due to market recovery and recent market share gains.\nWe anticipate this positive growth trend to continue and expand as increased 737 MAX production rates become a larger part of our order book.\nThe growth in Jet Engine Specialty Materials has been slower than Forgings, primarily due to excess inventory throughout the supply chain.\nAs anticipated, this inventory is being used up, though at an uneven pace depending on the customer and product type.\nIn Q2, sales of our Specialty Materials like Rene 65 for LEAP engines grew significantly compared to Q1, but were still lower than last year.\nWe expect demand for materials to keep increasing for narrow-body engines, but remain slow for wide-body engines.\nThis uneven demand, along with any remaining inventory, will result in somewhat irregular growth quarter-to-quarter for the rest of the year.\nThe airframe market in commercial aerospace continues to be weak.\nThis is mainly due to the well-known sluggish demand for wide-body aircraft caused by reduced international travel and excess supply chain inventory.\nWe expect this trend to persist throughout 2021 and possibly into early 2022 as the industry waits for a catalyst to increase wide-body production rates.\nOur newly acquired European OEM Airframe business starts production in the second half of 2021, initially at low levels.\nThis will partly offset the expected inventory reduction pressure at our main domestic airframe customer.\nAs mentioned earlier, Defense remains a growth market for ATI.\nOur diverse materials portfolio serves customers with a wide range of demanding applications, ensuring our success under almost any defense budget or economic conditions.\nOur Q2 growth was driven by naval nuclear applications and rotorcraft products to support increased demand for U.S. Navy ships and heavy-lift helicopters.\nWe expect our Defense business to continue growing and are seeing titanium armor plate demand return in the second half of 2021, supporting a new U.K. armored vehicle program.\nRegarding the Energy markets, we saw significant growth, mainly in our specialty energy portfolio.\nThese increases primarily supported land-based gas turbine production in Asia where energy demand is rising.\nSales to civilian nuclear customers contributed to this growth.\nLooking forward, we anticipate continued improvements in Energy markets as the world gradually reopens from pandemic lockdowns and economic growth drives increasing energy needs.\nTo conclude the market discussion, results were mixed in our two smaller differentiated markets.\nWe observed the expected return to growth in medical applications as hospitals perform more elective surgeries and diagnostic testing procedures.\nBoth our MRI and Implant Materials sales increased sequentially.\nWe anticipate demand to improve moderately over the coming quarters, led by MRI.\nIn the Electronics market, sales decreased from record levels in Q1 2021, but grew year-over-year.\nSales of ATI's specialty alloy powders increased compared to both prior periods.\nWe expect demand for these products to remain strong for the rest of 2021.\nI'd like to address several areas, including our Q2 financial performance, our balance sheet, and our outlook.\nOn a reported basis, ATI lost $0.39 per share in Q2.\nExcluding $40 million of strike-related costs and a small favorable adjustment to our restructuring reserves, the company lost $0.12 per share in Q2.\nTo fully understand our performance, it's necessary to look beyond the headlines.\nAs we mentioned in the last two earnings calls, the commercial aerospace recovery, particularly in jet engines, is gaining momentum and becoming more widespread within our business.\nThis is evident in our HPMC segment results, where jet engines account for over 40% of overall segment revenues.\nAs Bob shared, jet engine revenues increased by more than 20% sequentially for ATI as a whole and for HPMC.\nVolumes in our Forgings business continue to expand, building on growth from the previous two quarters.\nUnderlying demand for our Specialty Materials accelerated significantly for the first time since the pandemic began.\nIn addition to jet engines, revenues in each of HPMC's key end markets grew compared to Q1, led by specialty energy, including materials for land-based gas turbines produced in Asia.\nDue to our profitable jet engine growth and increased asset utilization, HPMC EBITDA margins increased by 220 basis points compared to Q1 and nearly 300 basis points versus Q2 2020.\nWe anticipate Q3 growth across HPMC's key end markets, most notably jet engine and specialty energy, and further utilization benefits from increasing production rates across our network.\nWe expect robust incremental margins over the coming quarters as profitable jet engine revenues increase and structural cost improvements executed throughout 2020 are maintained.\nQ2 financial results were clearly impacted by the 105-day strike in the SRP business.\nIt's worth noting that while we removed strike-related costs from segment earnings, segment revenues also declined nearly $140 million compared to Q1 due to plant outages and resulting production declines.\nNo adjustments were made for these revenue headwinds.\nDespite the short-term impacts on 2021 performance, we achieved the necessary long-term cost structure changes that will help SRP compete more effectively in the specialty materials marketplace.\nRegarding the AA&S segment, our Precision Rolled Strip business in Asia continues to operate at robust levels with revenues in line with its record-setting Q1, well above the previous year.\nEarnings from this business were below Q1 levels due to unfavorable mix.\nEarnings from our SA&C business were below Q1 and the previous year, largely due to unfavorable mix and elevated production costs.\nLooking ahead in the AA&S segment, we expect the SRP business to begin recovering in August.\nDue to the prolonged strike in July and inefficiencies in restarting production, we expect additional costs of about $25 million in the third quarter.\nWe anticipate strong performance from the Asian Precision Rolled Strip division during its typically busiest season, as device makers prepare for holiday sales.\nThe SA&C division is likely to see slightly lower earnings sequentially due to scheduled maintenance shutdowns in the third quarter.\nIt should be noted that corporate costs and closed company expenses in the second quarter were higher compared to the previous year and quarter.\nCorporate expenses exceeded last year's figures primarily due to incentive compensation accruals, and were higher than the previous quarter mainly because of foreign exchange losses.\nClosed company expenses surpassed both the first quarter and previous year, largely due to non-recurring benefits in those earlier periods.\nAs we've mentioned in recent quarters, our decisive cost-cutting measures from 2020 continue to benefit the company.\nThese actions help minimize decremental margins during periods of declining year-over-year revenue.\nWe anticipate these measures will positively impact the bottom line when revenues return to year-over-year growth.\nThe second quarter results of the HPMC segment provide a glimpse of what can be expected in upcoming quarters.\nDespite flat HPMC revenues compared to the previous year, earnings increased by 30%.\nThis earnings growth was achieved primarily by increasing production rates at numerous segment facilities and streamlining cost structures.\nNevertheless, there is still room for improvement.\nSome facilities, such as our nickel powder operations in Bakers, North Carolina, continue to operate on reduced schedules due to low demand.\nMeanwhile, others are still producing large quantities of lower-margin transactional products as commercial aerospace markets recover.\nLet's now discuss the balance sheet and liquidity.\nAs has been the case throughout the pandemic, we've taken steps to enhance our debt profile and have prioritized our balance sheet to ensure sufficient cushion against any potential challenges.\nDespite the recent strike, we concluded the quarter with approximately $830 million in total liquidity, including at least $475 million in cash.\nOur managed working capital levels increased in the second quarter, partly due to higher inventories in our SRP business resulting from strike-related inefficiencies.\nAccounts receivable and accounts payable balances also contributed to the higher working capital levels in the second quarter.\nWe remain focused on improving inventory turnover as we increase production.\nWe anticipate working capital levels as a percentage of sales to improve significantly in the latter half of the year.\nLooking forward, we plan to contribute up to $50 million to our U.S. defined benefit pension plan in the third quarter to enhance our funding status and long-term leverage profile.\nThis contribution exceeds minimum requirements but aligns with our goal to reduce pension exposure.\nFurthermore, we will continue to actively manage our debt maturity profile in the coming quarters.\nAs mentioned earlier, we expect continued improvement in our Jet Engine business, driven by growth in Specialty Materials and ongoing benefits from our cost structure.\nIn the AA&S segment, we anticipate higher sequential SRP volumes.\nWe will also experience increased maintenance and production costs due to a temporary production shutdown related to our transformation efforts.\nOur SA&C business will be negatively affected sequentially by its typical summer maintenance shutdowns, resulting in lower revenues and higher expenses compared to the second quarter.\nWe expect earnings from our Asian Precision Rolled Strip business to increase sequentially due to higher electronics volumes.\nAs a result of the new USW labor agreement, we have reduced our contractual funding requirements for post-retirement medical benefits.\nThis will result in a one-time non-cash pre-tax gain of approximately $65 million in our third quarter results.\nThis benefit and the associated $15 million tax charge will be excluded from our adjusted earnings.\nOverall, we expect third quarter adjusted earnings to range between breakeven and a loss of $0.08 per share, excluding strike-related costs and the $65 million post-retirement medical accounting gain.\nGains in the HPMC segment will likely be partially offset by maintenance shutdowns and production expense challenges in the AA&S segment.\nWhile we cannot accurately predict fourth quarter results due to ongoing uncertainties in the aerospace production ramp-up, we expect adjusted earnings to return to profitability in Q4 and continue improving in 2022.\nLastly, due to the negative impact of strike-related earnings, we now anticipate full-year free cash flow to be at breakeven to slightly positive levels.\nWe will work diligently to offset the strike's cash impact by maintaining discipline in capital spending and aggressively seeking working capital improvements throughout the latter half of the year.\nI am confident we will achieve our goal of generating positive free cash flow in 2021.\nWe are eager to accelerate along this path of end market recovery and fully expect a leaner ATI to demonstrate its capabilities, expanding market shares and margins in the process.\nOur second quarter financial results showed solid sequential improvement.\nWe are observing commercial aerospace recovery in our forward order load.\nWe sense momentum building at ATI, particularly within our HPMC segment.\nImproving aerospace market conditions will greatly benefit ATI as we have streamlined our cost structures and have higher shares of critical, high-growth customer programs.\nI am confident that when these volumes return to pre-pandemic levels, we will be an even stronger and more profitable company.\nThe AA&S segment will benefit from growth in defense, energy, medical, and electronics sectors.\nTransformation is progressing as planned in our Specialty Rolled Products business.\nWe have made significant and structural changes to optimize our product portfolio, consolidate and upgrade our facilities, and align our cost structure for future success.\nWe are developing a leaner and more profitable SRP business that exceeds its cost of capital, has substantial profitable growth opportunities, and can successfully compete for investment within the company.\nI'll conclude with three key points.\nATI is a growth-oriented company with the necessary cost structure for success.\nWe are well-positioned in key markets to achieve above-GDP growth over the long term.\nThe transformation of our product portfolio is on track and will yield significant benefits.\nWith a clear strategy and innovative team, we are accelerating our future.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Before we begin, there are a few matters to address.\nWe will be submitting our 10-Q report to the SEC today.\nThe SEC has experienced some delays.\nHowever, we will complete this task today.\nThese cover the quarterly results and our strategic growth plans.\nThose viewing online will see the slides appear on their screens.\nAudio-only participants can access the slides via our website.\nAn icon on the homepage allows viewing of these slides.\nWe'll start with our standard precautionary statement.\nFactors such as weather, regulatory changes, competition, and other risks outlined in our SEC filings may impact our performance.\nThe Company may not update this information in the future.\nOur CFO will begin today's call by reviewing the quarter and nine-month results.\nEric Wintemute, our Chairman and CEO, will then discuss our strategic growth initiatives.\nBob Trogele is also available to answer any questions.\nWe plan to keep you updated on our progress towards these goals, similar to how we report on key business performance indicators like inventory and borrowing capacity.\nAs Bill mentioned, our 10-Q for the three and nine months ending September 30th, 2020 is scheduled to be filed today.\nI'm aware that the agency assisting with our filing currently has a backlog of documents.\nThis document provides more detailed information on everything I'm covering here.\nAs previously stated, our Company operates in industries considered critical infrastructure in all our operating countries.\nConsequently, our customers and suppliers have largely continued operations without interruption during the pandemic.\nThis trend persisted through the third quarter.\nNevertheless, the pandemic has affected us in certain ways, such as limiting our ability to present new sales and marketing ideas, including new products, to customers in person.\nWe've also noticed customer purchasing patterns seem to have moderated due to pandemic-related uncertainties.\nConversely, these restrictions have led to reduced operating expenses.\nManaging these market changes has been challenging.\nDespite this, we've maintained profitability throughout this difficult period.\nFor the quarter ending September 30th, 2020, our net sales decreased by 6% to $117 million, compared to $125 million in the same period last year.\nWithin this overall decline, US sales dropped by about $7.5 million while international sales remained stable.\nInternational sales made up 43% of total net sales, compared to 41% in the same quarter last year.\nThe key factors influencing our third quarter sales performance are as follows.\nIn the US crop market, sales were impacted by reduced cotton acreage, which USDA statistics show has decreased by about 11% or 1.5 million acres in 2020.\nLower cotton commodity prices led growers to plant alternative crops.\nOur market performance was also affected by severe drought in West Texas and frequent hurricanes in the Southeast USA, both limiting growers' ability to apply our products.\nOn a positive note, we saw stronger than expected demand for our fumigant products in the potato markets.\nThis better-than-anticipated performance is attributed to the cautious reopening of schools and restaurants across the United States.\nIn our domestic non-crop market, there were minor quarter-over-quarter changes, with some decline in pest strip products used in bars and restaurants affected by pandemic restrictions.\nRegarding international sales, which were overall flat, three main factors were at play.\nFirstly, we had very strong performance in Mexico, Central America, and Australia.\nIn contrast, our Brazilian sales declined in real terms due to reduced insect pressure and difficulties meeting with customers due to pandemic restrictions.\nAdditionally, sales translated from local currency to US dollars were further negatively impacted by declining local currency exchange rates quarter-over-quarter.\nLastly, while Mocap and Nemacur sales were lower in Europe, both products saw significant sales increases in other parts of the world.\nThe table shows that the US crop market experienced reduced sales.\nThis aligns with reports from other market participants for Q3 results.\nOur international business increased as a percentage of consolidated net sales, and our relatively low exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations was advantageous this quarter.\nThe nine-month performance reflects similar market dynamics to those described for the quarter.\nOur US crop business was affected by reduced cotton acreage and cautious input decisions by growers as the pandemic's impacts unfolded.\nTo offset this, our fumigant sales performed better than expected as schools and restaurants reopened.\nWe also benefited from sales of products acquired in fall 2019.\nOur non-crop mosquito control business has been slightly below expectations due to storm intensity in our main markets, primarily because vector control districts are using existing inventory.\nLastly, our international sales have performed well despite currency devaluation challenges in some key markets.\nRegarding our gross profit performance, the trends are similar for both the quarter and year-to-date.\nIn our US crop business, the decline in gross profit was driven by lower cotton product sales, partially offset by strong fumigant sales.\nIn non-crop, reduced sales of Dibrom and pest strips negatively impacted the quarter, somewhat offset by strong sales in our horticultural business, which has slightly lower margins.\nWe also recorded higher royalty income from our Envance technology business this quarter.\nFor international business, the impact of declining foreign exchange rates was fully offset in the three-month period and partially offset in the nine-month period by strong performances in Central America, Australia, and Mexico.\nAs a result of these various factors, gross margin decreased from 38% to 37% for the quarter and from 39% to 38% for the nine-month period.\nOur manufacturing performance was strong this quarter, with well-controlled factory operating costs and improved activity compared to 2019.\nGenerally, our long-term net factory costs amount to about 2.5% of net sales, reflecting some latent capacity in our plants for potential needs.\nThis available capacity is necessary for effective production planning management.\nIn the third quarter, our factories cost approximately 2.4% of sales, compared to 2% in the same period last year.\nThe third quarter is typically a strong manufacturing period for the Company.\nDuring the initial nine-month period, net factory expenses totaled 1.6% compared to 2.4% of net sales in the equivalent timeframe of 2019.\nOur operational costs decreased in the quarter ending September 30th, 2020, when compared to the same period in the previous year.\nThe actual performance surpasses its parent company's published reports because we received a benefit from adjusting earn-out liabilities on previous acquisitions in 2019.\nThis advantage did not occur again in the current year.\nHowever, we recorded a benefit of about $1 million in the third quarter due to updating our environmental risk assessment for the Brazilian business acquired in early 2019, which reduced our liability in this area.\nAs previously reported this year, our operating expenses decreased due to lower travel and entertainment costs resulting from pandemic-related restrictions in all our operational jurisdictions.\nOur expenses were also reduced due to currency devaluation effects in key markets for the Company, including Mexico, Brazil, and Australia.\nFor the nine-month period ending September 30th, 2020, our overall expenses have decreased compared to the same period in 2019.\nThe reported reduction actually underestimates the real improvement because we benefited from $3.5 million in earn-out liability adjustments related to past acquisitions in 2019, which did not recur this year.\nConsequently, our underlying costs have decreased by approximately $5.5 million or 5% for the nine-month period.\nThe factors contributing to reduced costs are similar to those in the quarter.\nWe've spent less on travel and entertainment due to pandemic restrictions.\nBoth short and long-term incentive compensation, tied to financial performance, has decreased in 2020 compared to 2019.\nLastly, operating expenses incurred in non-US dollar currencies have decreased due to the devaluation of the previously mentioned currencies.\nI've noted unfavorable exchange rate changes in three key currencies from the Company's perspective.\nTo provide more context on that comment:\nIf we had used the 2019 exchange rates for both the three and nine-month periods of 2020, our reported net sales would have increased by $3 million for the quarter and $7 million for the nine months.\nRegarding gross margin, we would have recorded an additional $700,000 in the three-month period and $1.7 million year-to-date.\nDespite these impacts, we've effectively implemented natural hedges.\nThis means that most of our operating expenses for businesses in each territory are also in local currency.\nThis mitigates the impact on sales and gross margin, resulting in relatively insignificant differences at the bottom line due to translation exposure.\nThe Company experienced significant transaction-related exposures during the first quarter of the year.\nThis has decreased as exchange rates have stabilized at new levels during the second and third quarters.\nWe recorded lower interest expense in the third quarter compared to the same period last year.\nOur average debt was lower than the previous year, and we benefited from reduced borrowing rates in the US.\nFor the nine-month period, our average debt was slightly higher than the previous year, but we gained from the lower federal base rate, resulting in significantly lower interest expense.\nFinally, our effective tax rate continues to decrease compared to the previous year as we have stronger international performance in jurisdictions with lower rates this year compared to last year.\nIn the three-month period, we earned $0.10 per share compared to $0.11 per share in the same period of the previous year.\nFor the nine-month period, we earned $0.25 per diluted share compared to $0.34 per share last year.\nFrom my perspective, the Company's operating and financial focus remains as follows:\nWe continue to follow a disciplined approach in planning our factory activities, balancing overhead recovery with demand forecasts and inventory levels.\nAt the end of September 2020, our inventories were at $176 million compared to $186 million at the same time last year.\nDuring the intervening periods, we have made acquisitions and added inventory as a result.\nThe underlying period-over-period improvement in our base inventory before the impact of recent acquisitions amounted to approximately $14 million or 7.5%.\nWe are highly focused on our balance sheet as we navigate through this pandemic period, and having lower inventories at this point of the year is pleasing to report.\nAs we look at the final quarter of the year and our target for December 31st, 2020 inventory, Eric will comment shortly about acquisitions that we closed in the first and second week of the final quarter of this year.\nConsequently, our inventory forecast will now be amended to incorporate these new businesses.\nIn previous conference calls, we expected to end in the region of $145 million.\nGiven our latest operations planning assessment, we anticipate that our underlying inventory will increase slightly from our prior forecast.\nAdditionally, the new acquisitions that Eric will mention shortly are expected to add approximately $15 million at December 31st, 2020.\nAccordingly, our latest forecast is to end the year at approximately $160 million to $165 million, effectively flat with 2019, but including the addition of inventory from recent acquisitions.\nOur business has a distinct annual cycle, and we routinely experience expansion in working capital in the first part of the year and a reversal in the second part.\nDuring 2020, like most businesses, we have been highly focused on working capital and its impact on debt levels.\nDuring the period of the year when we typically expand working capital, we have contained the increase to only $5 million compared to adding $49 million in the same period of 2019.\nThis careful management of working capital is driving the improved cash generated from our operating activities.\nIn the first nine months of 2020, we have generated $19 million from operations compared to using $21 million in the first nine months of 2019.\nComparatively, that amounts to a positive change of $40 million period-over-period.\nAt September 30th, 2020, net indebtedness ended at $149 million compared to $165 million at the same time last year.\nDuring the last year, in addition to paying down $16 million in debt, we have funded more than $27 million in investments, including fixed assets, product acquisitions, and technology investments from the cash generated from operations.\nThese investments are focused on developing our consolidated business for the future.\nRegarding liquidity at the end of the third quarter, availability under our credit line was $45 million, which compares to $30 million at the same point in 2019.\nIn summary, for the third quarter and for the nine-month period, though our sales were down, selling prices and gross margins in each territory remained good.\nWe are seeing stronger international performance this year, and the mix of US sales (generally higher gross margin) and international sales (generally lower gross margin) is tending to bring the average down slightly.\nOur factory performance improved compared to 2019, and our expenses for operating costs, interest, and tax are all lower in 2020 than in the comparable periods of the prior year.\nFrom a balance sheet and cash perspective, we are doing very well, managing working capital, and our debt is lower than this time last year, notwithstanding our investments in long-term growth of our business.\nFinally, availability under our credit line has improved.\nWith that, I will hand over to Eric.\nMany of our investors have expressed interest in our strategic direction and longer-term prospects, particularly in light of our increased emphasis on technology innovation.\nIn that spirit, rather than delving into the details of market conditions over the past reporting periods, I would like to look forward to where we hope to be in the next three to five years.\nWe have three primary growth platforms within our business: our core business, our green product lines, and our precision application technology led by SIMPAS.\nThere are synergies between these platforms.\nFor example, SIMPAS is a market access tool for both core products and green solutions such as Agrinos biologicals.\nThere is some overlap between these platforms.\nFor guidance purposes, it's beneficial to examine each platform sequentially.\nOur primary business is primarily comprised of our synthetic chemical products.\nLet's create a model using a baseline of $468 million in annual sales, based on 2019 figures.\nWe've expanded our main business through three methods: organic growth via increased market penetration, developing new formulations or finding new uses for existing products, and through company acquisitions.\nWith a modest annual growth rate of 2%, we'd reach $507 million by the third year and $527 million by the fifth year through organic growth alone.\nNow, let's consider our new product pipeline.\nWe typically introduce multiple new products annually.\nIn 2020, we released five new formulations.\nAs these new products gain popularity and we continue to introduce more, we anticipate adding $37 million by year three and $109 million by year five.\nCombining our core business and new pipeline products, we project reaching $544 million by year three and $636 million by year five.\nNow, let's factor in acquisitions.\nWhile it's challenging to predict the acquisition market, it's currently very active.\nWe recently completed two acquisitions: Agrinos, a biologicals company, and AgNova, an Australian company that expands our presence in Australia and nearby regions.\nIf we conservatively estimate $20 million per year from acquisitions, this would add $60 million by year three and $100 million by year five.\nIncluding core business, new product pipeline, and acquisitions, we project a three-year top-line target of $604 million and a five-year target of $736 million.\nLet's now discuss our green solutions platform.\nBefore returning to the model, I'd like to update you on a recent acquisition.\nIn early October, we purchased Agrinos, Inc. and its sister companies at a favorable price during a liquidation auction by the Norwegian parent company.\nAgrinos produces and markets unique biological product blends for various markets and operates three factories.\nThe Oregon facility ferments a 22-species bacteria consortium into a product that improves soil health and plant growth.\nThe Mexican facility produces a microbially enhanced chitin-based product with similar applications.\nThe Indian facility produces biologicals for that region, including sales to the Indian government.\nThis investment has led us to create a biologicals team to manage these green product offerings globally.\nThis effort will also include managing the advanced TyraTech business.\nReturning to the model, some green solution businesses are already part of our core business.\nFor this discussion, we'll focus on the additional growth.\nBy the end of Q3 2020, we were on track to sell about $22 million in green products this year, including biologicals, bio-nutritional products, and essential oil products through Envance.\nWe'll use this figure as a baseline for our green products platform.\nWe're already in the consumer pest control market through P&G's Zevo product line and are expanding our essential oil products into other areas like lawn and garden, crop, and public and animal health.\nWith the addition of Agrinos, growth in other biologicals, and expansion of Envance/TyraTech, we expect incremental revenues of $48 million in year three and $118 million in year five.\nAdding green products to our previous projection of core business, product pipeline, and acquisitions would bring us to about $70 million in year three and $140 million in year five.\nNow, let's discuss our third platform: precision application.\nWe've been reporting on our SIMPAS technology, which we believe is at the forefront of prescriptive application systems.\nTo our knowledge, no other system allows a grower to apply multiple crop inputs variably in multiple rows automatically based on an agronomist's prescription.\nOur Ultimus technology can trace products from factory to field and precisely measure usage in any application.\nWe're also enhancing this technology for seed treatment at planting time.\nAfter positive field trial results in many states, several of our peers are conducting their own tests to make their products available in smart cartridges through SIMPAS.\nSome investors have asked for a clearer picture of where SIMPAS could be in three to five years.\nTo answer this, we'll consider revenue from our existing products applied prescriptively, sales of licensed active ingredients, royalties from third-party products marketed through our smart cartridges, and a share in growers' incremental yield benefits.\nUsing conservative estimates for domestic market penetration, we're targeting a top-line contribution of $35 million in year three and $131 million in year five.\nWe're confident SIMPAS will be well-received internationally and are planning field trials in Brazil in 2021.\nThese figures don't include potential revenues from our seed treatment innovation.\nCombining all platforms - Core, Green, and SIMPAS - we project roughly $687 million in year three and $985 million in year five, approximately doubling our current position.\nThere are many variables in this equation.\nWe'll continue to control what we can, such as managing working capital and operating expenses.\nWe're committed to maximizing our consolidated profit margin.\nWhile expansion into international distribution has lowered our gross margin percentage, we expect introducing newer technologies in these markets will improve profitability.\nI'll update you on our progress towards these targets in future calls.\nFocusing on the present and near term, 2020 has been an unprecedented year for this industry.\nDespite the pandemic, weather effects, and farm economy challenges, our Q3 2020 profitability matched Q3 2019, even with slightly lower sales.\nLooking ahead to Q4, we're seeing increased optimism in the domestic agricultural sector, partly due to rising crop prices for corn, soybeans, and cotton, which could improve grower profitability.\nIn the Midwest, with less crop rotation and more continuous corn planting, we're seeing a resurgence of soil insect pressure.\nDemand for our soil fumigant products is also increasing.\nBased on these trends and current sales activity, we're optimistic about our prospects for the rest of this year and into the 2021 season.\nWe're now ready to take your questions.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Kindly be aware that the financial information presented in this commentary is tentative.\nThese and other hazards, ambiguities, and crucial elements are elaborated upon in Franklin's recent submissions to the Securities and Exchange Commission, particularly in the Risk Factors and MD&A portions of Franklin's latest Form 10-K and 10-Q filings.\nLexington's operations provide us access to a vital growth sector in the alternative asset industry, and we are thrilled with this new collaboration.\nWe will discuss this transaction in more detail shortly.\nI'll begin by summarizing this year's key achievements.\nMatthew will then present our financial performance for the quarter and fiscal year, and dedicate some time to elaborating on today's significant transaction.\nThroughout Franklin Templeton's history, we have invested in our operations to create a truly diverse and robust organization that excels across market cycles, committed to serving our clients, employees, and shareholders.\nThe outcomes we announced today represent the first complete fiscal year since finalizing the Legg Mason acquisition, a transformative deal that established a more balanced business across asset classes, client mix, and geographical regions.\nWe are glad to report that the strategic and financial advantages from our Legg Mason acquisition surpassed our expectations, and we have incorporated important growth prospects.\nWe have preserved our culture while stimulating collaboration and innovation across the company.\nThrough our employees' hard work and dedication, we have successfully merged two firms to maximize our collective potential, combining global strength with boutique specialization.\nWe've made significant progress, yet in many ways, we're just beginning.\nRegarding investment performance, there has been an improvement across a wide range of investment strategies.\nAs of September, 71%, 69%, 72%, and 77% of strategy composites outperformed their respective benchmarks across the four key time periods.\nDuring the year, we focused on updating our global distribution efforts by enhancing our generalist-specialist model, reshaping client coverage, and deepening relationships in each sales region, especially with the largest global financial institutions.\nThe fiscal year's long-term inflows doubled to $365 billion from the previous year, notably, the U.S., our largest sales region with over $1.1 trillion in AUM, was net flow positive for the year.\nIn terms of notable organic growth, we observed positive net flows in our core growth areas, including alternatives, SMAs, wealth management, and ESG-specific strategies.\nWe executed important acquisitions to further expand and diversify our business in alternative assets, customization, and distribution of investment strategies.\nRegarding other accomplishments, our alternative asset strategies, a key focus area for us, generated positive net flows each quarter during the year and grew by 19% from the previous year to $145 billion in AUM, with contributions from various strategies including real estate infrastructure, private debt, and hedge funds.\nSeveral years ago, we announced our intention to create a comprehensive suite of alternative strategies, and we've been very deliberate in building our capabilities.\nIn 2018, the acquisition of Benefit Street Partners brought us a leading alternative credit manager.\nIn 2020, we added a world-class real estate manager with Clarion Partners.\nThis focus on alternatives led us to today's announcement of the acquisition of Lexington Partners, a leader in secondary private equity and co-investments.\nWe now have top-tier specialist investment managers in all key alternative categories, including Benefit Street Partners, Clarion Partners, Franklin Venture Partners, K2, and now Lexington Partners.\nSpecifically regarding the Lexington Partners transaction, I'm excited that Franklin will be collaborating with such an outstanding firm led by an experienced and talented team, immediately bringing scale and capabilities in an interactive and growing global market.\nThere will be no changes to the team or its independent investment management process, and they will continue to operate autonomously as Lexington Partners.\nAt the completion of this deal, we anticipate our alternative assets under management to reach about $200 billion and revenue to exceed $1 billion, not including performance fees.\nMatthew will soon provide more specifics about the transaction.\nAn additional key growth sector is our individually managed account division.\nWe rank among the top three providers in separately managed accounts with $125 billion in managed assets, representing one of the fastest-growing areas in retail investing.\nOur separately managed account business experienced a 22% year-over-year increase in assets under management and achieved positive net inflows each quarter during the fiscal year.\nOur recent purchase of O'Shaughnessy Asset Management and its Custom Indexing Platform, Canvas, will elevate our existing expertise in separately managed accounts, improving our capabilities in tax management, factor-based strategies, and ESG customization.\nCanvas, introduced in late 2019, has experienced robust growth since its launch and now accounts for $1.9 billion of the company's total $6.3 billion in assets under management as of September 30.\nThe acquisition will provide significant advantages to the clients served by both companies across various channels.\nIt's clear that investors are more concerned with ESG objectives than ever before.\nIncreasingly, investors consider three aspects of ESG: ESG factors as understood portfolio risks, ESG's contribution to overall returns, and the broader impact of ESG considerations on society and the environment.\nAs an active manager, about 95% of our assets under management represent strategies that incorporate ESG factors into the investment process, and ESG-specific strategies, accounting for over $200 billion in assets under management, experienced positive net flows each quarter this fiscal year.\nNevertheless, none of our achievements this past year would have been possible without our employees.\nWe are incredibly fortunate to have such committed colleagues who strive for investment excellence, cultivate lasting relationships, and provide exceptional service to our diverse global investor base.\nFourth quarter long-term net outflows totaled $9.9 million, partially offset by the acquisition of Diamond Hill's high yield-focused U.S. corporate credit mutual funds, which added $3.5 billion in assets under management and was completed in July.\nThis quarter included the previously announced $5.4 billion 529 plan redemption, comprising $4.7 billion in long-term assets and $2 billion fixed income institutional redemption with minimal revenue impact, as well as $800 million in fixed income outflows from non-management fee-earning India credit funds that are being liquidated.\nReinvested dividends amounted to $2.3 billion this quarter.\nA 1% increase in average assets under management of $1.55 trillion compared to the previous quarter, plus $69 million in performance fees, generated $1.66 billion in adjusted revenue for the fourth quarter.\nInvestment management fees, excluding performance fees, were 3% higher than the previous quarter.\nAdjusted operating expenses of $1.01 billion for the quarter were 3% lower due to reduced compensation and decreased general and administrative costs resulting from last quarter's upfront closed-end fund expenses.\nThis resulted in an 80% increase in adjusted operating income to $647 million and an adjusted operating margin of 39%.\nFourth quarter adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share rose 31% to $645 million, or $1.26 per share.\nThese results include favorable discrete tax items of $135 million or $0.30 per share for the quarter.\nRegarding the 2021 fiscal year financial results, which benefited from favorable market conditions and a full year of Legg Mason versus two months last year.\nFor the entire year, adjusted revenues were $6.32 billion and adjusted operating expenses were $3.94 billion, increasing by 63% and 65% respectively.\nThis led to a fiscal year adjusted operating income of $2.38 billion, which was 60% higher than the previous year.\nOur adjusted operating margin was 37.7%.\nRelative to the previous year, adjusted net income for the fiscal year rose by 46% to $1.92 billion, while adjusted diluted earnings per share grew by 43% to $3.74, including the effect of favorable discrete tax items totaling $175 million or $0.34 per share for the entire year.\nWe have successfully reached 85% of our targeted $300 million in merger-related cost savings this year, as originally planned.\nWe expect to fully realize these synergies by the conclusion of fiscal year 2022.\nIt's important to note that none of these cost-saving measures affected our specialist investment managers or investment teams.\nRegarding capital management, we believe our robust balance sheet continues to offer us financial and strategic flexibility to adapt our business.\nWe distributed $782 million to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks during the fiscal year ending September 30.\nThroughout the year, we also refinanced a significant portion of Legg Mason's existing debt with lower-cost debt, reflecting our improved credit standing.\nWe issued $850 million of 1.6% senior notes maturing in 2030 and $350 million of 2.95% notes maturing in 2051.\nOn March 15, 2021, we redeemed $250 million of 6.38% Legg Mason Junior subordinated notes due in 2056, and on September 15, 2021, we redeemed $500 million of 5.45% Legg Mason Junior subordinated notes due in 2056.\nWe concluded the quarter with $6.93 billion in cash and investments.\nWe will continue to prioritize our dividend and aim to repurchase enough shares to at least counterbalance our employee equity grants.\nThe remaining capacity will be directed towards ongoing investments in our business and acquisitions to further diversify and boost our cash flow sources, while positioning our company for new growth opportunities as the industry continues to evolve.\nAs detailed in the transaction summary, Lexington Partners is a global leader in secondary private equity and co-investments, currently managing $34 billion in fee-based assets.\nSince its establishment in 1994, Lexington has raised over $55 billion in total capital commitments and presently employs a team of 135 people across eight global offices.\nThe company is projected to generate revenue of approximately $350 million and EBITDA of around $150 million in 2022.\nWith this acquisition, we now possess strong and complementary capabilities in alternative credit, real estate, hedge fund solutions, and private equity-related activities.\nConsidering the overall size and growth of private equity and the potential for further expansion in private markets, having a specialist investment manager focused on this alternative asset sector is a logical step in diversifying our business.\nMoreover, providing access to diversified versions of high-yielding investments will become increasingly important in meeting the savings and retirement objectives of our broad client base.\nThis could also play a significant role in both our multi-asset solutions business and the ongoing development of our customization capabilities.\nAs Jenny previously mentioned, this transaction represents an important step towards creating a larger and more diverse alternative asset business, resulting in pro forma fiscal year 2022 alternative asset AUM of approximately $200 billion, generating about $1 billion in annual management fee revenue, excluding performance fees, at a margin of roughly 40%.\nWe plan to continue adding complementary businesses in both wealth management and asset management, including expansion in asset classes and geographic reach.\nThis will involve both organic investment through allocating capital to our existing specialist investment managers and through acquisitions.\nGiven our global presence, financial flexibility, business model, and experience in execution, we can attract highly talented teams and partnerships seeking a combination of independence, support, and collaboration on a global and local scale to create new growth opportunities in a large and expanding segment of the asset management industry.\nRegarding the financial aspects of the transaction, we are acquiring 100% of Lexington Partners for $1 billion in cash at closing, plus an additional $750 million in cash over the next three years.\nWe have structured this deal to ensure continuity and strong alignment of interests with Lexington's clients, partners, and employees over the long term.\nIn line with this approach, we will simultaneously issue grants equal to 25% of Lexington to its employees, subject to five-year vesting, and establish a performance-based cash retention pool of $338 million to be paid over the next five years.\nThe transaction is expected to be finalized by the end of our fiscal second quarter, pending customary approvals.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:These declarations should not be overly relied upon as they do not guarantee future results.\nFor a more comprehensive analysis of potential risks affecting our company's future performance and financial status, please refer to B&G Foods' latest Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings.\nBruce will now present our financial results for the third quarter and provide insights into our expectations for 2021.\nThe company exhibited robust performance in the third quarter.\nExcluding Crisco, our base business net sales increased by 9.2% compared to the same period two years ago, showing improvement from the 7% growth in Q2.\nOur Q3 2021 net sales, including Crisco, surpass last year's figures during the COVID period.\nBruce will later discuss specific categories and brands, but we're generally observing strength across our product range.\nWhen compared to pre-pandemic results from the third quarter of 2019, most of our key categories performed well.\nGreen Giant and spices & seasonings saw double-digit increases in net sales compared to 2019.\nNet sales of our leading Mexican food brands, Ortega and Las Palmas, increased by high single digits compared to 2019.\nOur baking brands, led by Crisco, Clabber Girl, Baker's Joy, and others, also demonstrated strong performance for the quarter compared to 2019.\nWhile demand remained high, resulting in increased sales.\nWe are also navigating through many of the same supply chain and cost challenges that have affected the industry.\nInflation for the full year 2021 is in the mid-single digits, with the second half seeing a double-digit increase across the portfolio.\nAs mentioned in our previous call, inflation on Crisco is significantly higher than the base portfolio due to major increases in soybean and canola oil prices.\nWe have responded by implementing significant price increases where appropriate, either by raising list prices or optimizing trade to directly offset higher input costs.\nAlthough we accurately identified and addressed inflationary pressures, most of our price increases take effect in the second half, with the largest increase on Crisco becoming effective at the end of September.\nWe anticipate continued inflationary pressure into the first half of 2022 and will adjust prices to recover year-over-year cost increases.\nAdditionally, we are implementing aggressive cost optimization measures to counteract ongoing inflation.\nRegarding supply, we continue to face shortages in packaging materials, freight delays, and contract manufacturing capacity constraints.\nHowever, overall customer service levels have been improving in recent weeks, aided by lifting allocations on Green Giant SKUs with the new crop pack.\nOur aim is to manage our business to maintain stable, steady margins.\nFor the current portfolio, we target an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 18%, using pricing and productivity actions to offset cost pressures on margins.\nIn the long term, we aim to improve to a 20% adjusted EBITDA margin through accretive M&A, efficiencies, and some organic growth in our base business.\nWhile inflation will make this more challenging in the near term, we believe this is the appropriate target for our business.\nDuring the third quarter, we successfully completed the integration of Crisco.\nI want to commend our team for executing a smooth transition.\nCrisco is our second-largest acquisition, and we are pleased with its performance year-to-date under our ownership, despite some volatility in commodity prices.\nIn August, we announced an agreement to sell our Portland, Maine manufacturing facility.\nWe expect the sale to close during Q1 2022.\nAlthough closing a factory is never an easy decision, it became evident that the 100-year-old Portland facility had reached the end of its useful life and was no longer cost-competitive.\nThe site will become the future home of the Roux Institute at Northeastern University, which is a positive outcome for the Portland community.\nWe continue to invest in our existing facilities, including a new high-tech automated line in the Ankeny, Iowa spices and seasonings facility, as well as new lines at our Hurlock, Maryland and Yadkinville, North Carolina facilities to increase our capacity for Ortega Taco Sauces and Taco Shells, respectively.\nAfter four months in the business, I wanted to share the key priorities and choices that the B&G team is focused on.\nFirst, effectively managing B&G Foods through the current inflationary and pricing environment; second, improving organic growth performance beyond COVID recovery; third, focusing on brands and categories where we have the capabilities, scale, and right to win in terms of both resources and structure; fourth, making disciplined acquisitions that are accretive to our portfolio and align with our core expertise in center store dry distribution; and fifth, accelerating cost savings and productivity efforts to eliminate non-value-added costs and strengthen margins. We will provide more details on these initiatives in future calls and discussions, including specific plans and updates.\nAs Casey mentioned, we achieved strong financial performance during our third quarter, despite a very challenging operating environment.\nNet sales remain elevated and are tracking closely to the initial assumptions we used to create our annual budget for fiscal 2021.\nIn line with our plan for the year, we are showing an acceleration in net sales growth as we progress through the year when compared to last year and our pre-pandemic 2019 numbers.\nAs we work through the remainder of the year, we are approaching a period that we expect to be more similar to last year – still not quite normal, with more Americans eating at home more frequently than they did pre-pandemic, but also no longer experiencing the height of pantry loading that coincided with the early days of the pandemic.\nAfter adjusting for the impact of Crisco and the extra week in last year's third quarter, we have achieved a net sales increase compared to 2018.\nWe have observed sales patterns that closely resemble those from the previous year's COVID-19-influenced third quarter.\nIndustrywide supply chain issues and increased input costs have limited some of the potential gains we would have seen from strong demand.\nSome of our brands could have higher sales if certain items weren't out of stock.\nMany of our brands have good sales, but profit margins are lower than what we typically expect from our portfolio.\nInput costs across our product range are generally up by mid-single digits, with some products like soybean oil, canola oil, transportation, and napkins seeing double-digit increases.\nSimilar to other food manufacturers, we are actively raising prices where appropriate and reducing costs where possible to maintain profitability and ensure our long-term margin structure.\nLet's review the highlights of the third quarter 2021.\nWe reported $515 million in net sales, $96.4 million in adjusted EBITDA before COVID-19 expenses, $96.2 million in adjusted EBITDA, and $0.55 in adjusted diluted earnings per share.\nAdjusted EBITDA, both before and after COVID-19 expenses, was 18.7% of net sales.\nNet sales of $550 million increased by $19.2 million or 3.9% from Q3 2020, and by $108.7 million or 26.7% from pre-pandemic 2019.\nCrisco, which we acquired in December 2020, generated $71.2 million in net sales in Q3 2021, surpassing our quarterly forecast and significantly outperforming its 2018 sales under previous ownership.\nExcluding Crisco, base business net sales decreased by $52.1 million or 10.5% in Q3 2021 compared to Q3 2020.\nIt's important to note that Q3 2020 included both COVID-19-enhanced sales and an extra week due to the 53-week fiscal year, which we estimate boosted net sales by about $35 million.\nThe negative comparison to 2020 is due to a $68.5 million decline in unit volume, partially offset by a $14.5 million benefit from increased net pricing, including list price increases, trade spend optimization, and slight mix changes.\nForeign exchange provided a $1.9 million benefit.\nYear-to-date, the cumulative benefit of net pricing changes is approximately $27.3 million.\nExcluding Crisco, base business net sales increased by 9.2% compared to 2019, representing a two-year compound annual growth rate of 4.5% over pre-pandemic sales.\nOur base business net sales growth in Q3 this year shows continued acceleration compared to 2019, improving upon our performance in Q1 and Q2 this year.\nWe generated $96.2 million in adjusted EBITDA in Q3, down $8.4 million or 8.1% from last year, but up $10 million or 11.5% compared to 2019.\nThe decrease in adjusted EBITDA versus Q3 2020 was primarily due to reduced base business volumes and increased input costs, including higher raw material prices, factory labor costs, transportation and warehouse expenses, and one fewer reporting week.\nThese costs were partially offset by locking in prices through short-term supply contracts, advanced commodity purchase agreements, cost-saving initiatives, price increases, trade spend optimization, and the addition of Crisco to the portfolio.\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.55 in Q3 2021, compared to $0.74 in Q3 2020 and $0.54 in Q3 2019.\nMost of our key brands saw decreased net sales when comparing Q3 2021 to Q3 2020, with about two-thirds of the decline due to one fewer reporting week in Q3 2021.\nHowever, most brands showed significant increases in net sales when comparing Q3 2021 to Q3 2019.\nFor some brands like Ortega and our spices and seasonings business, growth compared to 2019 was limited by production constraints.\nOther brands like Back to Nature and New York Style experienced sales declines compared to previous years due to supply chain issues.\nOrtega's net sales were $37.6 million in Q3 2021, up $1.6 million or 4.2% from Q3 2020 and up $2.6 million or 7.3% from Q3 2019.\nWith unlimited manufacturing capacity, Ortega's sales growth would have been even higher.\nDemand for Ortega taco sauce, shells, seasonings, and salsa remains strong, and we plan to continue investing in this brand and category.\nLas Palmas net sales were $9.1 million in Q3 2021, up $2.5 million or 37.1% from Q3 2020 and up $0.6 million or 7.3% from Q3 2019.\nLast year, Las Palmas experienced supply chain issues that limited our ability to meet demand for tomato sauces, but these problems have been resolved this year.\nSpices & Seasonings continues to be a major driver of our portfolio.\nNet sales of our spices and seasonings brands, including Accent, Dash, Tones, and Weber, were approximately $92.9 million, accounting for nearly 20% of our total company net sales for the quarter.\nSpices & Seasonings sales were down by about $14 million or 13.1% compared to Q3 2020, primarily due to capacity constraints as demand exceeded our supply and manufacturing capacity.\nAlthough this issue is improving and we anticipate it will be partly resolved by additional capacity coming online in late 2021 or early 2022, we are also comparing against an exceptionally strong quarter for spices & seasonings last year.\nCompared to Q3 2019, spices & seasonings sales were robust, increasing by about $10.3 million or 12.5%.\nWe have largely completed the 2021 packing season and have fully caught up on Green Giant supply.\nThis has led to improved performance starting in the latter half of Q3 and continuing to the present.\nGreen Giant's Q3 2021 sales of $141.2 million, while down $17 million or 10.7% from Q3 2020, are up $20.9 million or 17.4% compared to Q3 2019.\nWith an expected strong holiday season in November and December, we anticipate continued robust Green Giant sales through Q4 this year.\nFor other major brands, Maple Grove Farms generated $20.2 million in Q3 sales, down $0.5 million or 2.4% from Q3 2020 but up $2.7 million or 15.3% from Q3 2019.\nLikewise, Cream of Wheat's Q3 sales of $15.2 million were down $1.2 million or 7.4% from Q3 2020, but up $1.2 million or 8.5% compared to Q3 2019.\nOur gross profit for Q3 2021 was $105.7 million, or 20.5% of net sales.\nExcluding a $14.1 million accrual for an expected multi-employer pension plan withdrawal liability and $2.8 million in acquisition and non-recurring expenses, Q3 2021 gross profit would have been $122.6 million or 23.8% of net sales.\nQ3 2020 gross profit was $136 million or 27.4% of net sales, which would have been $136.1 million or 27.5% excluding $0.1 million in acquisition and non-recurring expenses.\nQ3 2021 gross profit was negatively affected by higher than anticipated input costs, including significant increases in raw materials, factory expenses, and transportation costs.\nWe've tried to mitigate inflation's impact on gross profits through short-term supply contracts, advanced commodities purchases, and cost-saving measures.\nAs mentioned earlier, we also implemented price increases and reduced promotions for certain products.\nThe immediate effect is that margins have been compressed relative to what we expect the business to generate in the short term.\nWhile this trend may persist into Q4 and early 2022, we anticipate our efforts will eventually restore the business to its historical margin profile.\nQ3 selling, general, and administrative expenses were $46.4 million, or 9% of net sales.\nThis compares to $43.4 million (8.8%) last year and $38.1 million (9.4%) in Q3 2019.\nThe increase in SG&A from last year is primarily due to a $3.5 million rise in warehousing costs and $3.3 million in additional acquisition-related and non-recurring expenses, mainly related to the Crisco brand acquisition and Portland facility sale.\nThe warehousing cost increase was largely driven by the Crisco acquisition and customer fines related to COVID-19 shortages and delays.\nAs previously stated, we generated $96.4 million in adjusted EBITDA before COVID-19 expenses and $96.2 million in adjusted EBITDA for Q3 2021.\nThis compares to adjusted EBITDA of $104.6 million in Q3 2020 and $86.2 million in Q3 2018.\nQ3 interest expense was $26.6 million, compared to $26.4 million in Q3 last year.\nThe slight increase in interest expense was primarily due to the Crisco acquisition, which was financed entirely with a combination of revolver draw and incremental term loans.\nThe revolver currently has an interest rate slightly below 2%, while the term loans are just under 2.75%.\nDepreciation and amortization have also increased year-over-year, mainly due to Crisco.\nQ3 2021 depreciation expense was $15.3 million, compared to $10.9 million in Q3 last year.\nQ3 2021 amortization expense was $5.4 million, compared to $4.7 million in Q3 last year.\nWe expect an effective tax rate of approximately 26% to 26.5% for the year, with slightly higher taxes in Q3 this year due to some discrete tax items, resulting in an effective rate of 26.8% for the quarter compared to 24.7% in Q3 last year.\nWe generated $0.55 in adjusted diluted earnings per share in Q3 2021, compared to $0.74 per share in Q3 2020 and $0.54 per share in Q3 2018.\nWe are optimistic about these trends.\nAlthough adjusted EBITDA margins will remain challenged this year due to higher than expected input cost inflation, including increased costs for raw materials, factory expenses, transportation, and warehousing, we still expect to generate adjusted EBITDA of $358 million to $365 million for the year.\nSimilar to last quarter's discussion, we expect the following for full-year 2021: interest expense of $105 million to $110 million (including cash interest of $100 million to $105 million), depreciation expense of $60 million to $65 million, amortization expense of $21 million to $22 million, and an effective tax rate of approximately 26% to 26.5%.\nAs mentioned at the start of the call, we had a relatively strong quarter despite comparing against elevated COVID-19 demand and an extra week in Q3 2020.\nWe remain on track to achieve the mid to high single-digit growth against 2019 that we set as a target for the year, and we continue to implement pricing actions to offset inflation in our portfolio.\nThis concludes our prepared remarks.\nWe will now begin the Q&A portion of our call.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:In today's conference call, we'll be discussing the third quarter results for 2020. Joining me are several key executives from our leadership team.\nOur actual performance may differ significantly from our projections, and the full impact of COVID-19 remains uncertain.\nWe can't guarantee that our strategies for addressing the pandemic will be effective, that the demand for our COVID-19 products will continue, or that we'll be able to meet market needs.\nDuring this call, we'll mention non-GAAP financial metrics that aren't defined under standard accounting practices.\nI'll now hand over to Ilan Daskal, our CFO, to continue the presentation.\nBefore delving into the quarterly details, I'd like Andy Last, our COO, to provide an update on how Bio-Rad is managing operations globally during the current pandemic situation.\nI'd like to take a moment to outline our current operational status worldwide.\nTo begin, we want to acknowledge the exceptional efforts of our global workforce in serving our customers throughout this pandemic.\nWe're truly grateful for the commitment and hard work demonstrated across our company.\nAs we navigate these challenging times, we're focusing on three key areas: ensuring employee safety, maintaining production to meet customer needs, and advancing our core strategic initiatives.\nWe've implemented standard safety protocols globally to protect our employees.\nWe've tailored our approaches to local requirements and are pleased with our productivity levels.\nRemote work continues where necessary, and for on-site staff, we've implemented extensive safety measures, resulting in minimal COVID-19 cases.\nIn the United States, we've introduced rapid testing for suspected cases using Droplet Digital PCR, allowing for quick results and minimizing work disruptions.\nOur manufacturing teams have shown great flexibility in adapting to pandemic-driven demand shifts.\nWe've ramped up production of PCR products to meet increased demand and scaled back where necessary, particularly for Diagnostics products.\nWe've largely overcome the initial supply chain issues encountered early in the pandemic and are well-prepared to meet future demands.\nWe continue to progress on our core initiatives, particularly in R&D, with all our laboratories now operational.\nLet me now review our third quarter performance.\nQ3 2020 net sales were $647.3 million, a 15.5% increase from $560.6 million in Q3 2019. Excluding currency effects, sales grew by 14.9%.\nWe experienced currency-neutral growth across all regions.\nWe saw strong demand for COVID-19 testing and related research products, but lower demand in other areas.\nOverall, Q3 showed gradual improvement in demand for both Life Science and Diagnostics products across all regions compared to Q2.\nMost academic and diagnostic labs are now operating at 70-90% capacity and slowly improving.\nBiopharma labs are running at a slightly higher 80-90% capacity. We're closely monitoring the situation.\nWe estimate COVID-19-related sales were approximately $98 million this quarter.\nLife Science Group sales in Q3 2020 were $324 million, up from $215.7 million in Q3 2019, representing a 50.2% increase as reported and a 48.8% increase when adjusted for currency effects.\nThe majority of year-over-year growth was driven by our core PCR products, Droplet Digital PCR, and Process Media.\nBoth core PCR and Droplet Digital PCR revenue increases were largely COVID-19-related.\nProcess Media, which can fluctuate quarterly, saw strong double-digit growth compared to the same quarter last year.\nExcluding Process Media sales, the Life Science business grew 53% on a currency-neutral basis compared to Q3 2019.\nThe expansion in the overall Life Science sector was counterbalanced by ongoing weakness in academic research demand, with laboratories worldwide operating at reduced capacity.\nWe anticipate a steady rise in laboratory usage and are vigilantly monitoring the situation.\nAcross all regions, Life Science sales increased on a currency-neutral year-over-year basis.\nWe remain optimistic about our Droplet Digital PCR business, which is gaining wider acceptance in wastewater testing as the industry benchmark.\nDroplet Digital PCR technology is now employed by the Environmental Protection Agency, The Water Research Foundation, and over two dozen laboratories worldwide for wastewater analysis, including Michigan's statewide standardized and coordinated COVID-19 monitoring network.\nFurthermore, we recently introduced two new PCR systems, the CFX Opus 96 and CFX Opus 384, bolstering our global response and contribution to combating the pandemic.\nAlongside the CFX Opus systems launch, Bio-Rad also unveiled access to a cloud-based platform for instrument connectivity, data management, and analysis.\nThese new PCR systems, combined with our Droplet Digital PCR offering, provide a comprehensive solution for our clients.\nClinical Diagnostics product revenue in the third quarter totaled $322.2 million, compared to $341.8 million in Q3 2019, representing a 5.7% decrease on a reported basis and a 5.9% decline on a currency-neutral basis.\nWe observed improved performance across all regions and product lines sequentially, which we believe indicates a recovery in routine testing trends.\nDuring the third quarter, robust performance in our quality controls products was offset by weakness across other Diagnostics portfolio areas.\nAlthough clinical laboratories have been significantly impacted by the pandemic, we are now seeing a gradual recovery from the Q2 low point and expect continued improvement through year-end.\nWe will carefully monitor the potential impact of the recent pandemic resurgence.\nThe Diagnostics Group reported declines across all geographic regions.\nThe reported gross margin for the third quarter of 2020 was 56.7% on a GAAP basis, compared to 54.8% in Q3 2019.\nThe current gross margin primarily benefited from improved product mix, increased manufacturing utilization, and reduced service costs, partially offset by higher logistics expenses.\nAmortization related to previous acquisitions recorded in cost of goods sold was $4.8 million, compared to $3.9 million in Q3 2019.\nSG&A expenses for Q3 2020 were $198.2 million or 30.6% of sales, compared to $201.6 million or 36% in Q3 2019.\nWe are continuing our cost-saving initiatives to reduce SG&A expenses.\nTotal amortization expense related to acquisitions recorded in SG&A for the quarter was $2.3 million, versus $1.9 million in Q3 2019.\nResearch and development expense in Q3 was $59.5 million or 9.2% of sales, compared to $47.9 million or 8.6% of sales in Q3 2019.\nQ3 operating income was $109.6 million or 16.9% of sales, compared to $57.5 million or 10.2% of sales in Q3 2019.\nExamining items below the operating line, the change in fair market value of equity securities holdings added $1,580 million of income to the reported results, primarily related to holdings of Sartorius AG shares.\nAdditionally, interest and other income resulted in a net expense of $5.5 million during the quarter, compared to $2.1 million of expense last year.\nThe effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.9%, compared to 22.8% in Q3 2019.\nReported net income for the third quarter was $1,315 million, with diluted earnings per share of $43.64.\nThis represents an increase from last year, largely due to changes in the valuation of Sartorius Holdings.\nTurning to the non-GAAP results.\nIn our non-GAAP analysis, we have excluded certain unusual and unique items that impacted gross and operating margins as well as other income.\nExamining the non-GAAP results for the third quarter, we have excluded $4.8 million of amortization of purchased intangibles and a small restructuring benefit from cost of goods sold.\nThese exclusions resulted in a non-GAAP gross margin of 57.5% for the third quarter of 2020, compared to 56% in Q3 2019.\nNon-GAAP SG&A in the third quarter of 2020 was 29.4%, versus 35.5% in Q3 2019.\nIn our non-GAAP SG&A calculations, we have excluded $2.3 million in amortization of purchased intangibles, $6 million in legal-related expenses, and less than $1 million in restructuring and acquisition-related benefits.\nNon-GAAP R&D expense in the third quarter of 2020 was 9.2%, versus 8.5% in Q3 2019.\nIn research and development, we've omitted minimal restructuring gains from our non-GAAP calculations\nThe aggregate of these non-GAAP modifications increases the quarterly operating margin from 16.9% (GAAP) to 18.8% (non-GAAP)\nThis non-GAAP operating margin is comparable to the 12% non-GAAP operating margin in the third quarter of 2019\nWe've also eliminated certain items below the operating line, including the 1,580 million increase in Sartorius Equity Holdings value and a minor loss related to venture investments\nThe non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.5%, down from 25.5% in Q3 2019\nThis quarter's lower rate was mainly due to changes in our geographical earnings distribution and the taxation of our overseas profits\nWe now project the full-year non-GAAP tax rate to be around 24%\nNon-GAAP net income for Q3 2020 reached $90.3 million, or $3 per diluted share, up from $48.6 million and $1.61 per share in Q3 2019\nTurning to the balance sheet\nTotal cash and short-term investments at Q3's end were $1,160 million, up $123 million from Q2 2020\nOur inventory grew by approximately $12 million from Q2 to Q3 2020\nThe Q3 2020 inventory increase was due to anticipated higher demand for COVID-19 related products\nWe anticipate inventory levels will decrease over the next two to three quarters\nWe intend to use available cash to pay off the $425 million of outstanding senior notes in December\nMoreover, the increased market value of our Sartorius AG holdings may technically classify us as an investment company under the 1940 Investment Company Act\nWhile we work on resolving this issue, our access to capital markets may be limited\nWe believe we have sufficient resources to effectively manage our business in the short term\nWe did not repurchase any of our stock during Q3, with $273 million still available for potential share buybacks\nQ3 2020 net cash from operating activities was $135.7 million, compared to $99.8 million in Q3 2019\nQ3 2020 adjusted EBITDA was 22.9% of sales\nQ3 2019 adjusted EBITDA was 17%\nQ3 2020 net capital expenditures were $20 million, with depreciation and amortization at $33.7 million\nWe expect full-year capex to be between $80 million and $90 million\nRegarding guidance\nWe remain uncertain about the COVID-19 pandemic's duration and impact, though we assume a gradual return to pre-pandemic activity levels and business mix\nWe currently project full-year 2020 currency-neutral sales growth of 5.9% to 6.3%\nWe forecast 27% to 28% currency-neutral revenue growth for Life Science and about 7% currency-neutral revenue decline for the Diagnostics Group in 2020\nThis assumes Q4 will see gradual improvement in non-COVID-19 related product sales and a smaller relative benefit from COVID-19 related product sales compared to Q3\nFull-year non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be between 56.5% and 57%\nR&D is projected at around 9%\nFull-year GAAP operating margin is estimated between 16% and 16.5%, with full-year adjusted EBITDA margin between 21% and 21.5%\nOur significantly higher operating profit over the last year resulted from discretionary cost control measures and improved product mix\nAs operations normalize, we expect a gradual reversal of the benefits experienced in 2020\nDue to the pandemic's uncertainty, we won't host an Investor Day this year, aiming to do so in 2021 when business activity normalizes\nWe plan to provide updated revenue growth and margin targets in December\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Today's discussion includes certain non-GAAP financial metrics that provide extra insights we believe are valuable to our investors.\nThese metrics have been aligned with corresponding GAAP measures as per SEC guidelines.\nPlease be aware of the risks and uncertainties mentioned during this call, which are detailed in our regular SEC filings.\nBarnes Group had an excellent start to 2021, with the anticipated recovery beginning earlier than expected.\nContinued strong order intake, sequential revenue growth for three consecutive quarters, and better-than-expected earnings performance strengthen our belief in significant recovery progress in the latter half of the year.\nIn the first quarter, organic sales decreased by 10% year-over-year due to lower Aerospace volumes.\nHowever, our Industrial segment achieved high single-digit organic growth, surpassing our February forecast thanks to robust orders and sales in March.\nWhile we initially expected business improvement as the year progressed, the stronger momentum at the end of the first quarter has led us to raise our annual outlook.\nEarnings per share were $0.38, a 46% decrease from last year's adjusted $0.71, but significantly exceeding our February projection's upper limit.\nLet's now examine end market dynamics, starting with Industrial.\nOur Industrial segment performed strongly in the first quarter, with all SBUs showing year-over-year organic sales and revenue growth.\nThe segment's orders increased by 25% organically, with a book-to-bill ratio of approximately 1.1.\nSequential orders rose by 7%, further demonstrating the momentum we're experiencing.\nAt a macro level, manufacturing PMIs in the US and eurozone remain particularly strong.\nChina, though slightly softer, continues to show expansion.\nDespite the semiconductor issue affecting automotive production, IHS still forecasts global production to increase by 12% over last year.\nWithin the segment, our Molding Solutions business saw strong orders across all brands, with a 35% organic increase.\nOur major end markets - automotive, medical, packaging, and personal care - each experienced over 25% order growth, some significantly higher.\nOrders improved sequentially by high single digits, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of sequential growth.\nOrganic sales increased by mid-single digits, while sequential sales rose by low single digits.\nThe book-to-bill ratio was approximately 1.1.\nBacklog, primarily consisting of our longer-cycle mold systems, grew by about 25% year-over-year and low double digits from Q4 2020.\nMolding Solutions' activity is very encouraging, and the business has been recruiting more talent for the sales and marketing team, focusing on driving long-term growth and margin expansion.\nWhile short-term investments in talent and our innovation and digital initiatives may temporarily impact margins, we anticipate long-term performance benefits.\nWe've improved our 2021 outlook for Molding Solutions, now forecasting organic sales growth in the low teens.\nIn Force & Motion Control, organic orders increased by low double digits, with organic sales up by high single digits.\nFMC is benefiting from its automotive customers' shift towards electric and hybrid vehicles in the sheet metal forming market.\nYear-over-year orders have increased across our primary geographic markets: North America, Europe, and China.\nWe're also seeing strong demand in our general industrial end markets, particularly in heavy-duty trucks and industrial equipment.\nWe've raised our FMC sales growth expectation and now anticipate organic sales to increase by mid-teens in 2021.\nEngineered Components achieved organic order growth exceeding 25% and organic revenue growth in the low double digits.\nWe saw modest sequential growth in orders and sales, somewhat constrained by automotive semiconductor concerns.\nWe estimate a first-quarter impact of about $1 million due to this issue, with a potential second-quarter impact of $4 million to $5 million before recovery in the second half.\nGeneral industrial markets remain very robust.\nWe've also increased our 2021 outlook for this business, now forecasting organic sales growth in the mid-teens.\nIn Automation, we continue to see sequential improvement in both orders and sales, up low teens and high single digits, respectively.\nYear-over-year organic sales increased by high single digits, and organic revenues grew by mid-teens.\nThe Automation team had a very good quarter of growth and execution.\nDemand for our end-of-arm tooling solutions in automotive, medical and pharma, and industrial automation applications remains strong, continuing the trend from recent quarters.\nWe now expect 2021 to deliver total growth of 20%, with organic growth in the mid-teens, surpassing our February projection.\nFor the entire Industrial segment, we anticipate 2021 organic growth in the mid-teens, with operating margins of approximately 13%.\nShifting our focus to the Aerospace sector.\nThe Aerospace division continued to feel the effects of the pandemic, with OEM sales declining 32% and aftermarket sales dropping 48% compared to the previous year, as commercial aviation remained significantly disrupted.\nNevertheless, we believe the worst is behind us and we are gradually recovering.\nAs evidence, we have observed a sequential improvement in total Aerospace sales for three consecutive quarters.\nIn the initial quarter, our MRO business drove the sequential improvement.\nOur outlook for the Aerospace industry remains unchanged.\nWe anticipate modest improvement in narrow-body OEM production levels, while wide-body production will continue to face challenges.\nWe observed strong orders for the second consecutive quarter, with an OEM book-to-bill ratio of approximately 1.5.\nIn the aftermarket sector, challenges persist, including reduced aircraft usage, diminished airline profitability, and government-imposed travel restrictions.\nThe speed and efficacy of vaccine rollouts will determine the recovery timeline.\nDomestic travel is expected to rebound before international travel improves.\nWe anticipate a gradual improvement in aftermarket activity beginning in the latter half of 2021.\nIn the interim, the Aerospace team is implementing various measures to position our business for recovery.\nFor instance, in the first quarter, we expanded our West Chester, Ohio facility, enhancing our capabilities, received supplier recognition from Boeing and Rolls-Royce, and secured a significant B-2 Bomber Exhaust System contract from Northrop Grumman.\nOur 2021 projections remain unchanged, with OEM sales expected to increase by mid-single digits compared to 2020, and spare parts sales anticipated to decrease in the mid-teens.\nWe have slightly improved our MRO forecast, now expecting a low single-digit decline instead of the previously projected mid-single-digit decrease.\nWe anticipate the segment operating margin to be around 13%.\nJulie is an accomplished executive with extensive experience in managing financial operations for global enterprises.\nHer comprehensive background and proven strategic leadership in corporate finance, financial planning and analysis, mergers and acquisitions, and risk management will contribute to advancing our long-term profitable growth strategy.\nTo conclude, we have begun 2021 on a positive note.\nEncouraging macroeconomic indicators and our robust order generation provide us with strong confidence in our improved outlook for the year.\nNevertheless, we acknowledge that challenges persist, and our teams are proactively developing risk mitigation strategies.\nAs we progress, we will continue to recruit the necessary talent and skills to drive growth and enhance profitability.\nThese efforts will be supported by our organic investments in innovation, digitalization, and strategic marketing.\nOur primary focus remains on controlling our own destiny and positioning the company to thrive as global markets recover.\nLet's begin by examining the highlights of our first quarter results, as shown on Slide 4 of our supplement.\nFirst quarter revenue totaled $302 million, a 9% decrease from the same period last year, with organic sales declining 10% due to ongoing pandemic impacts on our Aerospace end markets.\nThe sale of the Seeger business negatively impacted sales by 2%, while favorable exchange rates contributed a positive 3% impact.\nOperating income amounted to $32.4 million, compared to $49.3 million in the previous year.\nRelative to last year's adjusted operating income of $51.7 million, the first quarter saw a 37% decrease, with an operating margin of 10.7%, down 490 basis points from the adjusted 15.6% of the previous year.\nIt's worth noting that this outcome was anticipated.\nThe first quarter of the previous year saw record-breaking performance in the Aerospace aftermarket, which generated exceptionally strong margins.\nInterest expense decreased by $400,000 to $3.9 million, resulting from lower average borrowings, partially offset by a higher average interest rate.\nOur effective tax rate for the quarter was 28.1%, lower than the 31.5% rate from the previous year.\nThis decrease is primarily attributed to the absence of tax expenses related to the completed Seeger business sale and a reduction in the statutory tax rate at one of our international operations, both of which occurred in the first quarter of 2020.\nThese factors were partially offset by the impact of the global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) tax on foreign earnings in the first quarter of 2021.\nNet income totaled $19.4 million, or $0.38 per diluted share, compared to $29.7 million, or $0.58 per diluted share, in the previous year.\nOn an adjusted basis, net income per share decreased by 46% from $0.71 in the previous year.\nThe previous year's first quarter adjusted net income per diluted share excluded $0.13 of Seeger divestiture adjustments.\nNow, let's examine our segment performance, starting with the Industrial division.\nFirst quarter sales for the Industrial segment reached $220 million, a 10% increase from the previous year.\nOrganic sales grew by 8%.\nThe divestiture of the Seeger business negatively impacted sales by 3%, while favorable foreign exchange rates, primarily driven by the euro to US dollar exchange, increased sales by 5%.\nCompared to the fourth quarter of 2020, consecutive sales increased by 5%.\nThere's positive news regarding revenue, with three consecutive quarters of growth and a favorable year-over-year outcome.\nThe Industrial segment's operating profit for Q1 was $21.3 million, an increase from $17.9 million in the same period last year.\nThe rise in operating profit was due to increased volume and improved productivity.\nThese gains were partially offset by higher staff expenses, including performance-based compensation.\nThe previous year saw a reduction in quarterly incentive compensation, while this year anticipates an increase based on 2021 performance expectations.\nExcluding $2.4 million in Seeger divestiture adjustments from last year, the adjusted first quarter operating income grew by 5% from the previous year's $20.3 million.\nThe adjusted operating margin decreased by 50 basis points from 10.2% compared to the previous year.\nOne factor contributing to this is the additional investments being made in the Industrial segment.\nAs Patrick mentioned, these investments are firmly focused on our long-term growth strategy.\nWhile our Industrial end markets and businesses are showing signs of strong recovery, there are concerns about supply chain issues related to raw material availability, inflation, and increased shipping costs.\nRegarding raw materials, we've observed some customers extending their order commitment timelines to ensure supply availability and acknowledging the longer lead times required for certain materials.\nIn Q1, we experienced about $1 million in combined freight and material inflation in the Industrial segment.\nWe anticipate an impact of approximately $6 million for the full year, which is incorporated into our outlook.\nOur teams are addressing these issues, seeking to reduce risk exposure and take measures to counter inflation where appropriate.\nIn the Aerospace segment, Q1 sales were $82 million, a 38% decrease from the previous year.\nOperating profit fell by 65% to $11.1 million, primarily due to lower sales volume.\nThe operating margin was 13.6%, compared to a strong 23.9% a year ago.\nIt's worth noting that last year's margin was exceptionally high, driven by aftermarket contributions.\nThe Aerospace OEM backlog at the end of the quarter was $600 million, a 5% increase from Q4, and we expect to fulfill 45% of this backlog in the next 12 months.\nCash provided by operating activities in Q1 was $36 million, $12 million less than the previous year, while free cash flow was $28 million, down from $35 million last year, and capital expenditures decreased by about $4 million to $8 million compared to a year ago.\nRegarding the balance sheet, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio, as defined by our credit agreement, was 3.1 times at the end of the quarter, virtually unchanged from the previous quarter.\nThe Company is fully compliant with all credit agreement covenants and maintains sufficient liquidity to fund operations.\nAlthough we expected the leverage ratio to peak with our Q1 2021 results, we performed better than anticipated due to stronger financial results in the first quarter.\nWe anticipate further reduction in leverage from this point, barring any acquisition activity.\nOur average diluted shares outstanding for Q1 was 51 million shares.\nWe now plan to resume some share repurchase activity to offset equity compensation dilution, with additional share repurchases depending on various factors related to capital deployment and available growth opportunities.\nReferring to Slide 5 of our supplement, let's discuss our updated 2021 financial outlook.\nWe now project organic sales growth of 10% to 12% for the year, an increase from our previous estimate of 6% to 8%, driven by stronger industrial growth.\nForeign exchange is expected to have a 2% positive impact on sales, while divested Seeger revenues will have a minor negative effect.\nThe forecasted operating margin is approximately 13%.\nAt present, we don't anticipate significant residual restructuring charges, so there are no forecasted adjustments to 2021 net income.\nEarnings per share are expected to range from $1.78 to $1.98, a 9% to 21% increase from 2020's adjusted earnings of $1.64, which is higher than our previous projection of $1.65 to $1.90, and we anticipate the first half of the year to contribute about 43% of 2021's earnings.\nA few additional outlook items: Interest expense is expected to be around $16 million, while other expenses are forecasted at $8 million, both slightly better than our previous estimate.\nWe now expect capital expenditures to be approximately $50 million, down $5 million, with average diluted shares of 51 million and cash conversion over 100% remaining consistent with our prior outlook.\nLastly, we forecast a full-year tax rate of about 30%.\nHowever, we continue to analyze potential tax planning strategies to manage and reduce our overall tax expenses.\nIn conclusion, 2021 has started very well, supported by healthy orders for both segments.\nWith our focus on driving growth across the organization, we'll continue to invest in the business through capital expenditures and funding key strategic initiatives.\nWe believe these investments will help accelerate the recovery in our financial performance.\nLeverage remains very manageable and should improve from this point, allowing the balance sheet to accommodate our approach.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:To start, I want to commend all Church & Dwight staff worldwide for their ongoing commitment to maintaining our Company's operations during the pandemic, particularly our supply chain and R&D teams who overcame raw material shortages in Q1 due to the Texas freeze.\nLet's discuss the outcomes.\nThe first quarter was remarkably successful.\nWe saw a 6.3% increase in reported sales, with adjusted earnings per share at $0.83, exceeding our projection by $0.03.\nOrganic sales increased by 4.9%, propelled by higher consumption.\nThe growth of e-commerce continues unabated.\nOur online sales in Q1 grew by 54% compared to the previous year, accounting for 14.8% of total sales, up from 10.2% in Q1 2020.\nWe anticipate online sales will constitute 15% of total sales for the entire year.\nThe rollout of vaccines will significantly shape consumer behavior.\nThe United States is gradually reopening, leading to increased consumer mobility.\nAccording to an IRI study, 60% of vaccinated consumers are hopeful about returning to normal or a new normal, as we observe initial signs of consumers' willingness to spend more time in stores.\nIn contrast, many non-U.S. countries are still experiencing lockdowns.\nAs mentioned in the release, we've been facing raw material shortages due to the Texas freeze.\nRaw material and transportation costs surged in February, further exacerbated by the Texas freeze.\nWe expect supply constraints and higher input costs to persist throughout the year.\nTo offset these cost increases, we've announced price hikes in laundry products and across our international portfolio, while reducing couponing and promotional spending.\nRick will provide more details on this shortly.\nAt our January Analyst Day, we outlined which categories and brands we expected to remain elevated, recover from COVID lows, decline from COVID highs, or remain steady throughout 2021.\nOur overall outlook for the full year remains unchanged.\nTo highlight a few categories, we expect demand for vitamins, laundry additives, and cat litter to remain high in 2021.\nAs society reopens and consumer mobility increases, we anticipate year-over-year growth for condoms, dry shampoo, power flossers, and women's grooming products.\nWe expect baking soda, pregnancy test kits, and oral analgesics to decline from their COVID-induced highs.\nOf the 16 categories we compete in, 8 experienced consumption growth in Q1, some building on significant gains from Q1 2020.\nAmong these 8 categories, 5 saw double-digit growth: gummy vitamins, toothache remedies, battery-powered toothbrushes, pregnancy test kits, and women's electric grooming products.\nHousehold categories like laundry detergent and baking soda declined in the quarter, unable to match the substantial COVID-19 sales spikes seen in Q1 2020.\nRegarding Q1 market shares, 8 out of our 13 power brands either maintained or gained share within our U.S. Consumer Domestic business, which saw 5.1% organic sales growth.\nI'll now comment on a few specific brands.\nHealth and wellness have become a priority for consumers.\nVITAFUSION and L'IL CRITTERS gummy vitamins experienced impressive consumption growth of 24% in Q1, aided by new product launches mentioned in the release.\nIt seems new consumers are entering the category and staying, with one survey indicating a 90% repeat rate among new category entrants.\nWATERPIK saw 15% consumption growth in Q1 as it recovers from COVID lows and benefits from increased consumer focus on health and wellness.\nWATERPIK is also benefiting from dental offices returning to pre-COVID patient levels.\nWe expect our lunch 'n learn program frequency to normalize in the second half of this year.\nAlthough BATISTE continues to be affected by social distancing, consumption increased by 6%, and we achieved a record high quarterly balance share of 39%, driven by our International Women's Day campaign.\nNow, let's discuss the International division.\nDespite European lockdowns, our International business achieved 3.2% organic growth in the quarter, primarily driven by strong performance in our Global Markets Group.\nAsia continues to be a key growth driver for us.\nWATERPIK, FEMFRESH, and ARM & HAMMER led the growth for the International division this quarter.\nOur Specialty Products division experienced a positive quarter with 6% growth, mainly attributed to increased pricing.\nThe price of milk remained steady in the first quarter and is expected to rise later in the year due to increased demand.\nLet's now discuss New Products.\nNovel and innovative products will continue to draw in consumers.\nWe are launching OXICLEAN Laundry and Home Sanitizer in our household products line.\nThis product is unique as the first and only laundry additive that enhances stain removal while eliminating 99.9% of bacteria and viruses.\nThe product is also suitable for cleaning various surfaces throughout the home.\nIn personal care, VITAFUSION introduced Elderberry, Super Immune, and POWER ZINC gummies to meet growing consumer interest in immunity-boosting products.\nWATERPIK introduced ION, a compact water flosser that is 30% smaller, features a long-lasting lithium-ion battery, and is designed for smaller bathrooms.\nBuilding on its previous success, WATERPIK upgraded its SONIC-FUSION flossing toothbrush to version 2.0, now offering two brush head sizes and two speed settings.\nFLAWLESS is capitalizing on at-home beauty and self-care trends by introducing a facial cleansing system, a shower wand for a spa-like experience, and at-home nail care solutions.\nLet's now discuss the future outlook.\nWe've had a promising start to Q1.\nWe maintain our projection of 6% to 8% growth in adjusted earnings per share for the full year, aligning with our Evergreen target, despite increased input costs.\nBased on our expectations for consumer consumption, we've increased our full-year reported sales growth forecast from 4.5% to a range of 5% to 6%.\nWe've also raised our organic sales growth expectations from 3% to a range of 4% to 5%.\nConsumption trends through mid-April show year-over-year growth in 14 out of our 16 categories.\nIn conclusion, I'd like to highlight the many reasons to be confident in Church & Dwight.\nOur track record demonstrates our ability to perform well in both favorable and challenging economic conditions, including uncertain times like the present.\nThe categories we operate in are essential to consumers.\nWe offer a mix of value and premium products.\nOur power brands hold the top one or two positions in their respective categories.\nWe have minimal exposure to private label products.\nWith our strong financial position, we remain open to acquiring businesses that can enhance our Total Shareholder Return.\nRick will now provide details on Q1.\nWe'll begin with earnings per share.\nThe first quarter's adjusted EPS, excluding the positive earn-out adjustment, was $0.83, unchanged from the previous year.\nAs mentioned in earlier calls, the quarterly earn-out adjustment will continue until Q4, which marks the end of the earn-out period.\nThe $0.83 EPS exceeded our $0.80 projection, primarily due to sustained increased consumer demand for many of our products.\nReported revenue increased by 6.3%.\nOrganic sales grew by 4.9%, driven by a 3.1% increase in volume and a 1.8% positive price mix.\nLet's examine the segments.\nOrganic sales rose by 5.1% due to higher volume and positive price mix.\nGrowth was led by VITAFUSION and L'IL CRITTERS gummy vitamins, WATERPIK oral care products, FLAWLESS beauty products, ARM & HAMMER clumping cat litter, KABOOM bathroom cleaners, and VIVISCAL hair thinning products.\nConsumer International achieved 3.2% organic growth due to higher volume, partially offset by lower price and product mix.\nThis was an impressive result despite European writedowns.\nOur SPD business saw a 6% increase in organic sales due to higher pricing, partially offset by lower volume.\nMilk prices have remained stable month-to-month and are projected to increase as 2021 progresses.\nNow let's discuss gross margin.\nOur initial quarter's gross margin was 44.5%, showing a decrease of 120 basis points compared to the previous year.\nThe decline in gross margin was influenced by a 350 basis point increase in manufacturing expenses, mainly due to commodity costs, distribution, tariffs, and COVID-related impacts.\nThe Texas freeze exacerbated commodity issues, causing a 90 basis point reduction in margin.\nTariffs had a negative effect of 40 basis points on the gross margin.\nThese negative impacts were partially mitigated by a 190 basis point increase from price/volume mix, a 170 basis point improvement from productivity initiatives, and a 10 basis point positive effect from favorable currency exchange rates.\nWe had previously projected a 50 basis point decrease in gross margin for the quarter.\nThe entire discrepancy was attributed to a sudden rise in commodity prices and a constrained transportation market.\nWe anticipate margin improvement in the latter half of the year, driven by pricing and promotional strategies outlined in our release, as well as the anniversary of higher inflation and tariffs experienced in the latter half of 2020.\nWe increased our marketing expenditure by $2.3 million compared to last year to support our brand.\nMarketing expenses as a proportion of net sales decreased by 30 basis points to 8%.\nFirst quarter adjusted SG&A increased by 60 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to amortization of acquisition-related intangibles.\nWe also increased investments in IT and R&D, and incurred some transition costs from the ZICAM acquisition.\nOther expenses totaled $11.6 million, a $3.6 million reduction due to lower interest rates resulting in decreased interest expenses.\nOur effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.2%, an increase of 100 basis points from 23.2% in 2020, mainly due to fewer stock option exercises.\nIn the first three months of 2021, cash from operating activities fell by 57% to $100 million due to higher cash earnings being offset by an increase in working capital.\nInventory levels are higher to support increased sales and improve customer fill rates.\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses decreased due to the timing of payments.\nAs of March 31st, we had $128 million in cash on hand.\nWe maintain our full-year capital expenditure plan of approximately $180 million, focusing on expanding manufacturing and distribution capacity, particularly for laundry, litter, and vitamins.\nFor the second quarter, we project reported sales growth of about 4.5%, organic sales growth of roughly 4%, and a gross margin contraction of 350 basis points due to ongoing higher input costs and comparison to artificially low promotional levels from the previous year.\nWe expect adjusted earnings per share to be $0.69, a 10% decrease from last year's adjusted second quarter EPS.\nAs mentioned in our release, we conducted a voluntary recall of selected products in our vitamin business.\nWe anticipate the earnings per share impact in Q2 to be approximately $0.04, and we are seeking insurance reimbursement.\nFor the full year 2021, we now expect reported sales growth of 5% to 6%, surpassing our previous 4.5% outlook.\nWe've also increased our full-year organic sales growth projection to approximately 4% to 5%, up from the previous 3% outlook.\nWe now anticipate full-year gross margin to be flat, primarily due to higher raw material and transportation costs, and the impact of the Texas freeze in March.\nWe previously expected a gross margin expansion of 50 basis points for the year.\nRecently, we've observed a significant increase in raw materials and transportation costs.\nWe're absorbing $90 million in additional costs for the full year.\nHigher sales, reduced promotions, and price increases across all three divisions, representing about one-third of our portfolio, offset a large portion of the cost increases.\nWe price our products to protect gross profit dollars, not necessarily margin.\nOur full-year tax rate expectations have increased to 22% due to fewer stock option exercises, representing a $0.02 headwind compared to our previous full-year outlook.\nWe maintain our adjusted earnings per share expectations in the range of $3.03 to $3.06, a 6% to 8% increase year-over-year.\nOur cash from operations outlook remains at $1 billion, while we continue to seek accretive acquisitions.\nAs Matt mentioned, the company has had a strong start, and we anticipate 2021 to be another robust year.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Scott Oaksmith, Senior Vice President of Real Estate & Finance, will be accompanying them\nWe're pleased you could attend and trust everyone is doing well\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to significantly affect our company and the hospitality industry as a whole\nOur franchisees, their hotel employees, and Choice associates have shown exceptional resilience\nDespite the ongoing pandemic, I'm happy to announce that Choice Hotels has continued to deliver results that greatly exceed industry standards in the third quarter\nDomestic systemwide RevPAR outpaced the industry by almost 20 percentage points, only decreasing 28.8% compared to the third quarter of 2019\nAll our limited service brands experienced considerable RevPAR index improvements against local competitors\nWe managed to increase our effective royalty rate, indicating an continuously improving value proposition for our franchisees\nWe expanded our total system size, particularly in our higher revenue-generating upscale, mid-scale, and extended-stay segments\nWe attribute this success to Choice's key differentiators, such as our varied brand portfolio, the geographic distribution of our domestic system, our core customer profile, and our franchise-centric business model\nThese fundamental strengths have positioned us favorably to capitalize on the shifts in consumer demand that have occurred over the past eight months\nWe believe our strategy of expanding our limited service brands in appropriate segments and locations will enable us to continue increasing our share of travel demand in the long run\nAs we enter the ninth month of the pandemic, we're starting to observe trends that are likely to have a lasting impact on the travel industry\nLet's start with the trend of remote work and virtual learning\nSubstantial investments in remote access technology by businesses, schools, and consumers are creating more options for where and when traditional activities occur\nIn a post-pandemic world, this may provide Americans with even more flexibility in their schedules to travel for leisure\nFor the past few years, we've noticed a trend of leisure travel demand spreading more evenly throughout the year, which we partly attribute to changing school schedules and an increase in baby boomers retiring with more time and disposable income to travel\nMore employees can now work from any location with internet access, while their children attend virtual classes\nOver the past two months, we observed continued leisure demand extending into weekdays\nAnother trend is the rise in road trips\nWe're benefiting from this trend due to our high concentration of hotels in drive-to markets\nSince the pandemic began, consumers' preference for road trips has only grown as Americans show a clear inclination for trips closer to home\nDestinations that may have been overlooked before COVID-19 are now being reconsidered\nWith over 4,000 domestic hotels located within a mile of an interstate exit, our properties are well-positioned to serve travelers embarking on road trips\nAdditionally, with more than 2,000 domestic hotels near beaches and national parks, our properties are situated in the right markets to capture growing demand from travelers increasingly looking to explore the great American outdoors\nAnother emerging trend is the economic disruption caused by the pandemic and its effect on consumers as recovery takes place\nWe believe that during uncertain times, as in previous economic downturns, consumers will seek more affordable limited service hotel options, presenting an opportunity for our portfolio to capture this demand\nAnother anticipated economic effect of the pandemic is higher relocation rates\nAs people change jobs and industries, demand for longer-term hotel stays increases, a trend we believe will benefit our brands, particularly those in the moderately priced extended-stay segment\nLastly, there are indications that consumers' risk tolerance is increasing, even before a vaccine becomes available\nAccording to a recent survey, the perception of travel safety has improved, and Americans' likelihood to take a domestic leisure trip and stay in a hotel within the next six months is at its highest since mid-March\nAs a result of these trends, we've witnessed an increase in our weekday occupancy quarter-over-quarter, on top of the existing weekend leisure demand we've historically enjoyed\nIn fact, our weekday RevPAR index rose by eight percentage points year-over-year in the third quarter\nOur year-over-year RevPAR change continued to improve month-over-month during the third quarter\nAt present, we remain optimistic about seeing sequential month-over-month improvements in our year-over-year RevPAR change\nOur loyalty program has remained a key driver of our business throughout the pandemic, enhancing our ability to boost franchisees' top-line revenue\nWe particularly benefited from Choice Privileges Diamond Elite members, our most valuable customers, who contributed an even higher percentage of overall revenue year-to-date compared to last year\nWe anticipate this foundation of loyalty business to deliver even greater value in the future as more Americans resume travel and enrollments in our award-winning Choice Privileges loyalty program continue to grow\nOur long-term strategy of expanding the right brands in the appropriate segments and markets has allowed Choice brand hotels to consistently outperform the competition\nThroughout the third quarter, we achieved significant month-over-month increases in our proprietary revenue contribution to our hotels\nSpecifically, our website contribution increased by 400 basis points and our loyalty contribution rose by 120 basis points quarter-over-quarter\nThis has helped drive RevPAR index share gains against our local competitors across all location types, as reported by STR\nFor the 34 weeks leading up to October 31, we observed substantial RevPAR share gains compared to the competition\nIn the third quarter, all of our select service brands achieved significant RevPAR index gains versus their local competitors, with each of our upscale and extended-stay brands experiencing share gains exceeding 10 percentage points\nI will now provide a brief update on our segments\nOur high-end portfolio experienced significant year-on-year expansion in Q3, with our domestic luxury room count rising by 33%\nAscend Hotel Collection stands as the first and largest soft brand in the industry\nAscend Hotels, now boasting nearly 300 properties worldwide and soon to reach its 200th domestic location, delivered outstanding Q3 results: RevPAR growth surpassed the upscale segment by over 26 percentage points; RevPAR share gains against local rivals reached nearly 19 percentage points; and average daily rate index improved by about nine percentage points\nFor the last six months, Ascend has consistently outperformed both upscale soft brands and the segment overall in terms of year-over-year RevPAR growth\nOur extended-stay properties are specifically designed for long-term visitors\nChoice Hotels' brands in this recession-resistant category continue to excel in the current unprecedented climate, with our portfolio of over 420 extended-stay hotels growing 6% year-over-year in Q3\nWoodSpring Suites achieved a 77% average occupancy rate in Q3, maintaining monthly occupancy levels above 75% since late June\nSuburban extended-stay brand saw year-over-year occupancy improvements in Q3, enhancing its appeal to developers seeking a smart extended-stay conversion opportunity\nMeanwhile, our MainStay Suites mid-scale extended-stay brand gained over 16 percentage points in RevPAR index compared to local competitors in Q3\nWe remain positive about the growth prospects of our extended-stay portfolio, which saw a 9% year-over-year increase in its pipeline during Q3\nFrom January through September, Choice has awarded more than 40 extended-stay franchise agreements, showing continued interest in both new construction and conversion opportunities during a challenging period for the industry\nTurning to our mid-scale segment, these brands make up 2/3 of our total domestic portfolio and over half of the franchise agreements signed year-to-date\nAll our select-service mid-scale brands achieved year-over-year gains in RevPAR index and average daily rate index compared to local competitors through Q3\nThe Comfort brand gained over seven percentage points in RevPAR share versus local competitors in Q3\nClarion Pointe, a conversion brand extension of Clarion launched less than two years ago, recently opened its 20th U.S. hotel and now has over 50 properties open or in development, demonstrating strong growth as it expands coast-to-coast\nDespite the challenging environment, demand for Choice's brands persists, supported by our strong value proposition and recent performance\nDevelopers select our brands to increase the value of their hotels\nWe offer conversion brands to suit most developers' budgets, which has driven our development growth through past downturns\nFrom January through September, we've awarded over 230 new domestic franchise agreements, with nearly 70% being for conversion hotels\nIn Q3 alone, we executed over 80 domestic agreements, of which nearly 3/4 were for conversions and over 40% were signed in September\nWe have a long history of increasing the diversity of our ownership base through our unique emerging markets development team, which assists underrepresented individuals like minority and veteran entrepreneurs in entering the hotel franchising business\nAlmost 70% of our hotels have minority ownership\nDespite the pandemic, we've awarded and financially supported 17 franchise contracts with black and Hispanic entrepreneurs year-to-date\nRecently, we entered into the largest minority-owned multi-unit franchise agreement in the program's history\nOur long-standing commitment to diversity and further details about our efforts to improve the communities we serve will be outlined in our upcoming ESG report\nWhile this year's challenges have been unique, the cyclical nature of our industry is well-known\nIt's something our experienced and disciplined management team, many of whom have guided the company through previous downturns, has planned for\nOur resilient franchisee base also has extensive experience in leading their small businesses through down cycles, and they are central to everything we do\nThroughout the pandemic, we have supported our franchisees in several ways\nFirst, by reducing costs through extending brand program deadlines, implementing cost-saving operational initiatives, reducing certain fixed fees, offering a tailored fee deferral program, and modifying brand standards\nSecond, by attracting business through our global sales efforts targeting first responders and other essential travel; a multichannel, multi-brand marketing campaign; and tailored promotional programs\nFinally, by collaborating with hygiene and infection prevention experts like Ecolab to launch our Commitment to Clean initiative, ensuring their hotels are clean and safe\nWe have been and will continue advocating with policymakers for additional relief measures to assist small businesses and provide targeted help for the travel industry\nSpecifically, we're urging the creation of a second draw loan program for existing Paycheck Protection Program borrowers, greater accommodation and streamlining for borrowers to obtain forgiveness, and liability protections for hotel owners who comply with health and safety protocols during the pandemic\nWe've also called for additional stimulus to support American discretionary spending, including in areas such as travel\nIn conclusion, Choice Hotels is positioned to emerge from these challenging times stronger, as we have done before in our 80-year history\nOur proven portfolio of well-segmented brands, geographic footprint, and asset-light business model position us well to benefit from current consumer trends as they continue to evolve\nI'll now invite our CFO to provide his update\nI hope you and your families are well and healthy\nToday, I'd like to provide additional insights into our third quarter performance, update you on our balance sheet and liquidity, as well as our approach to capital allocation, and finally, share our thoughts on the outlook for the future\nLet's now examine our results more closely\nFor the third quarter of 2020, total revenues, excluding marketing and reservation system fees, were $103.6 million\nAdjusted EBITDA totaled $74.9 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of over 72%, and adjusted earnings per share were $0.66\nOur domestic systemwide RevPAR for the third quarter outperformed the overall industry by nearly 20 percentage points, declining only 28.8% from the same quarter of 2019\nAdditionally, our results exceeded the primary chain scale segments in which we compete, as reported by STR, by six percentage points\nOur brand strategy has consistently prioritized growth in the more lucrative upscale, extended-stay, and mid-scale segments, which is proving successful\nDuring the third quarter, these three segments outperformed their respective industry chain scales and local competitors in terms of year-over-year RevPAR\nOur upscale portfolio's RevPAR change surpassed the overall segment by 14 percentage points and outperformed its local competition by over nine percentage points\nWith an average domestic systemwide occupancy rate of 74%, our extended-stay portfolio's RevPAR change exceeded the industry by 40 percentage points and its local competitors by 14 percentage points\nThe RevPAR change for our mid-scale portfolio was nearly eight percentage points higher than the segment average\nThis RevPAR outperformance can be attributed to continued occupancy improvements and our franchisees' ability to maintain rates\nOur domestic systemwide occupancy rate has improved since its lowest point of 28% in early April\nFrom late June through October, our average weekly occupancy rates have consistently been above 50%\nWe've also seen improvements in our average daily rate index, which increased by 1.7 percentage points against local competitors in the third quarter\nThese specialists have been guiding our franchisees on optimizing their pricing strategies and providing advanced market intelligence and channel management\nDespite challenging conditions, we managed to expand our system size, with domestic hotels growing by 0.7% and rooms by 1.9% year-over-year\nOur more revenue-intensive brands in the upscale, extended-stay, and mid-scale segments saw even greater growth, with hotels increasing by 2.1% and rooms by 3.4% year-over-year\nWe're particularly pleased that Comfort, our flagship brand, continued to show positive unit and room growth in the third quarter following its brand transformation\nComfort's development success during these unprecedented times strongly validates the brand's value proposition\nComfort now accounts for nearly one-third of our total domestic pipeline, which will drive revenue-intensive growth in the coming years\nAdditionally, the brand's conversion pipeline grew by almost 50% in the third quarter compared to the previous year\nWe are especially satisfied with the company's performance regarding our effective royalty rate, which is driven by the attractive value we offer our franchisees, their ongoing desire to be associated with our strong brands, and our current pipeline\nOur royalty rate continues to be a significant driver of our revenue growth\nThe company's domestic effective royalty rate increased by seven basis points year-over-year to 4.91% in the third quarter and has risen nine basis points year-to-date compared to the previous year\nWe anticipate continued growth in this area for the rest of the year as owners seek the security of a large, proven franchisor that delivers strong top-line results and helps maximize their return on investment\nI'd like to discuss our balance sheet and capital allocation strategy\nThroughout the third quarter, we maintained our focus on reducing discretionary costs, exercising discipline in capital allocation, and effectively allocating resources to drive top-line outperformance, all of which improved our cash position and strengthened our liquidity\nWe reduced our net debt by approximately $50 million during the third quarter and are pleased to report cash flow from operations of $70 million for the nine months ended September 30, with over $68 million generated in the third quarter alone\nOur cash and liquidity profile remains exceptionally strong\nAt the end of the third quarter, the company had over $790 million in cash and available borrowing capacity through our revolving credit facility\nWe are on track to achieve our previously announced SG&A cost savings of nearly 25% in 2020 and expect to maintain a run rate of SG&A cost savings of approximately 15% in 2021 and beyond\nThe decisions we've made to better align our cost structure in the post-pandemic environment position us well to capitalize on opportunities as travel demand recovers, while allowing us to continue investing for the long term\nOur capital allocation approach, characterized by prudence and discipline, remains key to our success\nChoice's primary focus in this area has always been to increase organic growth by strategically investing back into the business, and that will not change\nWe are confident that our capacity and cash flows will allow us to weather the storm and increase the organic growth of our business by strategically investing in growing our brands and system size, executing our technology roadmap, and delivering proprietary franchisee-facing tools that help drive top-line revenues\nBased on our proven track record of success in organic growth, we believe these internal investments will drive attractive returns for years to come\nWe will continue to evaluate other investments and capital return opportunities in the context of evolving market conditions and our overall capital allocation strategy moving forward\nI'd like to share some thoughts on what lies ahead\nThe full and precise impact of the pandemic on our business for the remainder of 2020 and beyond remains largely unknown, as does the exact trajectory of our industry's recovery\nWhile we are not issuing formal guidance today, we currently expect that the impact of COVID-19 on the company's year-over-year RevPAR change will be less significant for the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter of this year\nOur outlook is based on the following factors\nFirst, we are observing continued resilience in leisure demand and continue to outperform the industry relatively\nSecond, despite entering the fall season when demand is historically lower, we are pleased that our fourth quarter domestic RevPAR change has continued the pattern of sequential quarterly improvement through the week of October 24\nIn fact, we expect our October 2020 RevPAR to decline by approximately 25% compared to the same period in 2019\nThe final reason for our optimism is the nature of the current environment\nUnlike the Great Recession, which was caused by underlying fundamental economic problems, the current economic downturn is tied to the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, which we believe could contribute to a faster recovery\nWe will continue to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 across the business and provide further updates in February during our next earnings call\nIn conclusion, we are optimistic that Choice Hotels is well-positioned to

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:The presentation slides for today's conference call can be found on our website, and we encourage you to view them as we proceed.\nWe caution listeners not to rely too heavily on these statements, which reflect management's views only as of today, April 29, 2020.\nOur SEC filings contain information about potential factors and risks that could impact our actual operational results.\nThe company is not obligated to revise or publicly announce any changes to statements made during this call, except through filings related to this reporting period.\nToday's discussion will reference non-GAAP financial measures.\nClean Harbors believes these metrics provide an additional way to measure and compare its performance consistently over time.\nLet's begin with Slide 3.\nBefore we discuss our first quarter results, I want to address the coronavirus outbreak and our response to it.\nThe pandemic has created a global health crisis and economic turmoil, and I hope you and your loved ones are staying healthy.\nAt Clean Harbors, employee safety is ingrained in our culture and is our top concern during this pandemic.\nAs an essential service provider with teams working on the front lines of the COVID-19 crisis, we've implemented strict safety measures and worked closely with suppliers to ensure our employees have the necessary protective equipment.\nThroughout the crisis, our field and plant workers have continued to support our customers' needs across North America.\nEmployees in critical administrative roles have supported our field teams remotely, with our robust systems enabling a nearly seamless transition.\nWe anticipate the virus will negatively impact our business in the second quarter, particularly in the Safety-Kleen division.\nSafety-Kleen has been affected by reduced driving and business activity across North America, as well as the steep decline in base oil prices.\nIn summary, we're facing challenging short-term market conditions and are taking significant measures in response.\nLet me highlight some of those actions.\nWe're aligning our cost structure with current demand by adjusting our workforce through furloughs and other reductions, implementing a freeze on non-essential hiring and wages, and restricting all travel.\nWe've also renegotiated with many vendors and suppliers for cost savings or improved payment terms.\nAdditionally, we've temporarily shut down half of our re-refining capacity due to the current base oil demand and anticipated decrease in used motor oil availability in Q2 and beyond.\nTo strengthen our financial position, we've drawn $150 million from our credit line in case the crisis worsens.\nWe've revised our net capital expenditure plans for 2020, reducing expected spending by over $50 million to conserve capital and support our free cash flow for the year.\nNevertheless, I believe our strong financial position puts us in a good place to succeed.\nMoving to our Q1 financial results on Slide 4.\nRevenue increased 10% compared to last year, with both operating segments showing solid growth.\nOur adjusted EBITDA reached a record $122.6 million, driven by high-value waste streams, high utilization, and contributions from projects and emergency response work.\nOur adjusted EBITDA margin improved by 130 basis points to 14.3%.\nTurning to our segment results, starting with Slide 5.\nEnvironmental Services revenue grew 11%, supported by contributions from our facilities network and Field Services group, and aided by mild weather throughout most of the quarter.\nAdjusted EBITDA growth of 22% was due to business mix, disposal volumes, and emergency response revenue.\nEmergency response work totaled $21 million, including COVID-19 decontamination efforts and cleanup of a chemical plant fire.\nOur disposal facilities saw impressive volumes this quarter, with incinerator utilization increasing to 86% and landfill tonnage growing 39%.\nOur average incineration price per pound in Q1 rose 11%, reflecting the record level of high-margin direct burn streams we collected.\nThe Environmental Service segment had another exceptional quarter.\nLet's move on to the next slide.\nSafety-Kleen's revenue increased by 8%, mainly due to growth in the SK Oil division.\nAdjusted EBITDA and margin improved due to lower transportation costs for SK Oil and higher rerefining production compared to last year when volumes were affected by frozen rivers and floods.\nThe SK branch business's core services performed well.\nParts washer services remained stable compared to the previous year, waste oil collection increased slightly to 55 million gallons, blended products made up 25% of volume in the quarter, and our direct volume was 7%.\nThe first quarter started with promising signs that IMO 2020 would allow us to expand our refining spread as high sulfur fuel oil values decreased and base oil prices rose in early January.\nHowever, the oil shock caused by the global coronavirus outbreak has largely sidelined IMO 2020, and base oil prices have dropped by $1 per gallon.\nWe entered the second quarter facing significant pressure on our rerefining spread.\nIn the current market conditions, used motor oil is in a charge-for-oil state.\nWe have significantly increased our charge-for-oil program in response to the current market situation.\nDriving in the U.S. and Canada must return to normal levels before our spread and lubricant demand can recover.\nWe will consider reopening our closed rerefineries when we see conditions improve.\nLet's look at the next slide.\nOur capital allocation strategy is more crucial than ever in the current environment.\nAs mentioned earlier, we are cutting our planned net capital expenditure by over $50 million.\nWe sold two businesses in Western Canada during the first quarter as we continued to reduce our direct exposure to the energy sector.\nSince starting our divestiture program several years ago, we have sold seven businesses for about $120 million in total.\nRegarding mergers and acquisitions, we are unlikely to be active in the near future.\nWe believe that in the long term, we will emerge from this market downturn in a stronger position, both financially and operationally, compared to some of our competitors, which will allow us to take advantage of opportunities.\nWe will likely pause our stock buyback program until we are certain that the domestic economy is clearly on the path to recovery.\nWe also plan to repay the $150 million on the revolving credit facility as soon as this crisis shows signs of ending.\nLooking ahead to our business segments, although we have experienced some cancellations and project delays due to COVID-19, we expect our Environmental Service segment to perform relatively well during the current downturn.\nWe anticipate that our decontamination work and increasing volumes of infection waste will help offset what would otherwise be a larger decline.\nIn the Safety-Kleen segment, we expect both our branch business and SK Oil to be significantly impacted, particularly in the second quarter, as stay-at-home orders greatly reduce vehicle travel and generate less used motor oil.\nOur SK branch business should recover as shelter-in-place mandates are lifted and low gasoline prices encourage people to drive more.\nIn SK Oil, our rerefining spread has narrowed due to the drop in crude oil prices, and we have aggressively increased our charge-for-oil pricing, but volumes are down and near-term demand for base oil has decreased.\nTo summarize, our first quarter results demonstrated the strength of our business model, the value of our assets, and our frontline role in emergency response.\nOur market leadership, financial liquidity, and positive free cash flow will enable us to navigate this global crisis.\nI want to reiterate Alan's comments about the outstanding work of our team and everyone on the front lines of the crisis.\nThe unprecedented events of the past few weeks have given us all a deeper appreciation for the professionals, especially healthcare workers, who risk their lives daily to help those in need.\nLet's move on to Slide 9 and our income statement.\nAs Alan mentioned, we achieved record first quarter results.\nSales increased by approximately $78 million, with adjusted EBITDA rising by about $21 million.\nThe quarter's performance was influenced by the variety of services provided, project activities, and favorable weather conditions.\nIn terms of gross profit, we experienced a significant increase in both total amount and percentage, attributed to improved utilization, better pricing, and a beneficial comparison to the previous year.\nOur gross margin saw a rise of 160 basis points compared to last year.\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses increased by $14.5 million during the quarter due to higher revenue, investments in personnel, and some non-recurring expenses from the previous year.\nMoving forward, we are concentrating our cost-cutting efforts in this area to align expenses with our revenue.\nDepreciation and amortization in the first quarter decreased slightly to $47.5 million.\nWe acquired two small complementary businesses in 2019 while also selling off several operations.\nFor 2020, we anticipate depreciation and amortization to be between $285 million and $295 million, which is slightly lower than the previous year.\nOperating income grew by 92% to $45.5 million, setting a first-quarter record, reflecting our revenue growth and enhanced gross profit.\nAccording to GAAP, earnings per share were $0.21 in the first quarter, compared to $0.02 in the same period last year.\nOur adjusted earnings per share amounted to $0.28.\nLet's examine the balance sheet on Slide 10.\nAs Alan mentioned, we borrowed $150 million from our credit line during the first quarter, which increased our cash and short-term marketable securities to $494.3 million at the end of the quarter.\nWe observed reasonable accounts receivable collection towards the end of March, contributing to a healthy cash balance.\nOur strong liquidity position further safeguards our company and provides additional financial flexibility if needed.\nOur balance sheet remains in a good position.\nCurrent and long-term debt obligations at the end of the quarter increased to $1.7 billion, reflecting the drawdown on our credit line.\nOur weighted average cost of debt is now 4.3%, with a balanced mix of fixed and variable debt.\nLeverage on a net debt basis was 2.2 times for the trailing 12 months ending March 31.\nLooking at our most recent cash balance from yesterday, our cash remains essentially unchanged from the end of the first quarter.\nThe team has done an excellent job maintaining focus on collections and managing our expenses.\nLet's review cash flows on Slide 11.\nCash from operations in the first quarter increased slightly to $33.7 million.\nCapital expenditures, net of disposals and the purchase of our headquarters, were $59.9 million, higher than last year, resulting in adjusted free cash flow for the quarter of negative $26.2 million, which aligns with the previous year and our expectations.\nFor the year, we are now targeting capital expenditures, net of disposals and purchase of our headquarters, to be between $140 million and $160 million.\nDuring the quarter, we bought back approximately 300,000 shares of our stock at an average price of $57.41 per share, totaling $17.3 million.\nAs Alan mentioned, we will be cautious in our approach to buybacks until we see evidence that markets are well into their recovery phase.\nAs Alan also noted, given the uncertain market conditions, we are withdrawing our 2020 guidance.\nWe hope to reinstate guidance with our second-quarter earnings announcement, provided markets have stabilized.\nTo summarize, the first quarter was strong, marked by several financial records, including adjusted EBITDA.\nIf not for COVID-19, our first-quarter results would have set us up for the fourth consecutive year of profitable growth.\nWe have implemented significant measures in response to the pandemic and are prepared to take additional steps if the recovery is prolonged.\nWe are focusing on factors within our control, including careful cost management and seeking new waste streams for our landfills and incinerators.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Accompanying me on the call are Arsen Kitch, our CEO and President, along with Mike Murphy, our CFO.\nThe company released its Q4 2020 financial results shortly after the market closed today.\nOverall, the company reported Q4 net sales of $453 million and adjusted EBITDA of $72 million.\nThis represents year-over-year growth of about 4% and 38%, respectively, compared to Q4 of the previous year.\nI'd like to highlight a few key points from our business performance.\nOur tissue division drove results with increased sales and production volumes compared to last year, meeting unpredictable demand that surpassed our expectations.\nOur sales volume in the quarter matched our production levels.\nOur paperboard division also delivered strong results.\nWe have substantial order backlogs, which influenced our decision to implement a $50 per ton price increase across our SBS product range, effective February 2.\nDuring Q4, we utilized the generated free cash flow to further reduce our net debt by $58 million.\nOn the fourth slide, as I've mentioned in previous quarters, we continue to prioritize our employees' health and safety, as well as maintaining safe operations to serve our customers during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOur risk mitigation strategies are proving effective in reducing COVID-19 risks at our facilities.\nOur HR and manufacturing leadership teams are doing an outstanding job of proactively monitoring our workforce's health and ensuring adequate staffing levels.\nThe dedication of our employees has been crucial to our success thus far and will continue to be essential.\nTo acknowledge our entire team's efforts during these challenging times, we distributed a one-time discretionary bonus of $1,000 to over 2,800 employees in November.\nWe're also actively encouraging all our staff to receive the COVID-19 vaccine by offering a $200 incentive.\nI want to express my sincere appreciation to our entire team for their exceptional efforts and resilience during this difficult period.\nAs we begin to see the positive effects of widespread vaccine distribution, I urge everyone to remain vigilant until COVID-19 is under control and behind us.\nI will now provide an overview of our tissue and paperboard divisions' performance in the fourth quarter.\nLet's begin with our Consumer Products division, as shown on slide five.\nAs previously mentioned, at-home tissue demand was unpredictable during the quarter.\nNew waves of the pandemic led to significant demand spikes from mid-November through mid-December.\nWhile we initially expected demand to be at or below Q4 2019 levels, we were reminded of the unpredictability of essential product demand during this time.\nMike will provide more details on Q4 demand patterns during his remarks.\nOur team and customers are effectively managing this volatility, and we benefited from higher-than-expected sales and production volumes in Q4.\nOur industry outlook remains largely unchanged, which I'll summarize in a few key points for context.\nFirstly, remember that the U.S. tissue market is traditionally split 2/3 at-home and 1/3 away-from-home, with limited manufacturing flexibility to switch between the two.\nWith consumers spending more time at home, there has been a shift towards at-home consumption.\nDemand fluctuations have been and will continue to be driven by consumer behavior.\nWe anticipate that as COVID-19 vaccines are administered and infection rates decrease, there will be a shift back to away-from-home consumption, which we expect will negatively impact us as we primarily focus on the at-home market.\nHowever, it's uncertain whether there will be lasting changes in consumer behavior post-COVID.\nSecondly, while it's too early to determine private brand share trends, we continue to observe that paper towel demand is outpacing the overall tissue category, while facial tissue demand is lagging.\nPrivate brands have consistently gained market share relative to branded products over the past decade, a trend we expect to continue.\nWe will continue to monitor these trends in the coming months and quarters due to ongoing uncertainty in consumer demand related to COVID-19.\nThirdly, as noted in previous quarters, SKU rationalization has occurred, facilitating increased production.\nWe believe that reduced SKU counts benefit both retailers and manufacturers like us.\nAlthough some customers are expressing interest in recovering SKUs, we don't expect SKU counts to return to pre-COVID levels in the near to medium term.\nOur tissue division performed strongly in Q4.\nWe shipped 13.9 million cases, up approximately 5.3% compared to Q4 2019.\nSales decreased by 4.2% compared to Q3 2020.\nAs mentioned during our Q3 earnings call, we ended relationships with several customers to reduce complexity and improve our network, which impacted Q4 results and is expected to affect Q1 2021 results as well.\nWe are optimistic about our sales pipeline for the remainder of 2021.\nAs a reminder, we estimate that roughly 2/3 of paperboard demand comes from products that are more recession-resistant, while 1/3 is driven by more economically sensitive or discretionary products.\nOur folding carton customers, particularly those focused on food or healthcare packaging, continue to experience strong demand, while our food service customers, especially those concentrated in quick-service restaurants and away-from-home dining, continue to face weaker demand.\nWe are pleased with the market reception of our sustainability-focused brands, Nuvo Cup and ReMagine folding carton.\nBoth are playing a significant role in our favorable market position.\nWe're encouraged by our solid performance in the quarter and continued strong demand for our products.\nWe recently announced a temporary suspension of production at our Cypress Bend facility due to natural gas curtailment in Arkansas.\nNatural gas deliveries were reduced to the point where we could no longer operate.\nWe estimate that the costs associated with the weather event across our paperboard system, including lost production, repairs, and spikes in natural gas prices, could impact us in Q1 by approximately $6 million to $8 million.\nWe continue to experience the same fundamental supply and demand dynamics that led us to announce a $50 per ton price increase in January.\nDemand remains robust and our backlogs have grown since the beginning of the year.\nThe implementation of price increases has begun and is expected to take several more months to fully complete.\nThe consolidated company summary income statement displays fourth quarter results as well as full year figures for 2020 and 2019.\nFor the fourth quarter, diluted net income was $1.34 per share and adjusted EBITDA reached $71.6 million, while full year diluted net income was $4.61 per share with adjusted EBITDA of $283.2 million.\nThese figures show substantial growth compared to previous periods, largely due to increased tissue demand from COVID-related consumer behavior, benefits from the Shelby investment, favorable raw material costs, and the absence of a major planned outage in the paperboard division.\nThe relevant segment results can be found on slide eight.\nThe paperboard business maintained strong adjusted EBITDA performance, while consumer products saw benefits from significant sales growth and fixed cost leverage related to production increases and favorable input costs.\nBefore delving into divisional performance details, it's worth noting changes in how we present our financial bridges.\nWe have altered our approach to include production volume changes in the volume category rather than the cost category as previously done.\nWe believe this modification will help investors better understand sales changes, as we expect to produce similar quantities to what we sell, which will all fall under the volume category.\nThe cost category will now more accurately reflect changes in raw material input pricing and inflation.\nThis sheeting service distorts the sales price of our base paperboard products.\nWe have also decided to implement some accounting changes that will affect our financials starting in 2021, which we want to bring to your attention today.\nThese changes and their pro forma impact can be reviewed in our 8-K filing.\nBail pulp sales from our Lewiston mill to third parties, previously recorded in our tissue business, will now be recorded in our paperboard business.\nBail pulp sales from Lewiston to our tissue operations will be transferred at market price going forward, rather than at cost.\nWe believe this change will more accurately reflect the economics of the business.\nWe will continue to transfer pulp from the Lewiston pulp mill to the Lewiston tissue operations at cost due to the co-located nature of these assets.\nAs a reminder, we started our new Shelby, North Carolina paper machine in the second quarter of 2019, incurring expected start-up costs related to lower production throughput, higher waste, and other expenses throughout 2019.\nWe reached the targeted production rate for our new paper machine in the second quarter of 2020 and continue to reap the benefits of the project, including ramping up our converting lines, realizing supply chain savings, and achieving sales wins and mix improvements.\nWhile we're not providing specific dollar amounts for these costs and benefits, the ongoing realization of the Shelby investment is a key factor in our performance improvement.\nOur product mix continues to improve as Shelby has come online, more than offsetting some year-over-year price impacts.\nWe're benefiting from volume increases related to the production ramp, which helped meet elevated demand.\nOverall, lower input costs, improved mix, and fixed cost leverage from increased production positively impacted our tissue business in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019.\nA comparison of our fourth quarter 2020 performance to the third quarter of 2020 can be found on slide 17 of the appendix.\nSlide 10 provides additional context on tissue related to demand volatility and its impact on our financial performance.\nThe IRI panel data, which shows retail sales of tissue in dollars, illustrates what our customers and we have observed in consumer demand patterns, with the line showing year-over-year changes and the box data showing quarterly comparisons to the previous year.\nAs we ended the third quarter, we anticipated elevated but stable demand.\nBased on that demand profile, sufficient inventory levels at our customers, and slowing demand from customers in October, we expected softness in our fourth quarter sales.\nHowever, a consumer-driven demand spike in mid-November through December rapidly changed this outlook.\nThis period of volatility, including the October pullback mentioned in our third quarter earnings call and strong orders in November and December, serves as a reminder that we may not return to a stable order pattern until COVID-related volatility subsides, affecting our ability to forecast the business.\nWe've included an additional slide in the appendix of the supplemental materials detailing the weekly volatility in IRI panel data experienced by our customers and supply chain.\nOur fourth quarter sales were 13.9 million cases, representing a 4.2% unit decline from the third quarter but a 5.3% unit growth compared to the previous year.\nProduction in the quarter was 13.9 million cases, down 9% from the third quarter but up 2.4% from the previous year.\nProduction levels have benefited from the Shelby ramp and SKU rationalization.\nThe cost leverage from the significant increase in production, along with improved costs in freight and logistics, led to continued strong year-over-year results.\nSlide 11 shows a year-over-year adjusted EBITDA comparison for our paperboard business.\nLower pricing, as reported by RISI in February 2020, was partially offset by favorable mix.\nThe absence of a planned major outage at our Cypress Bend mill also contributed to year-over-year improvement.\nOverall, our team operated our facilities well in the quarter and continued to deliver strong results.\nA comparison of our fourth quarter 2020 performance to the third quarter of 2020 can be found on slide 18 in the appendix.\nSlide 12 provides insight into our first quarter outlook and some key drivers for the full year 2021.\nAs previously discussed, the tissue outlook is largely dependent on sales demand.\nTissue shipments in January were 4.6 million cases, with February shipments trending below 4 million cases.\nAt this pace, we expect first quarter shipments to be lower than levels seen in the first quarter of 2020, when COVID initially impacted consumer buying patterns, and down compared to the fourth quarter of 2020.\nAs mentioned earlier, our paperboard business announced a price increase of $50 per ton across our SBS grades, effective February 2.\nGiven the nature of our agreements and customer discussions, we expect the benefits of this increase to be reflected over the next couple of quarters, with limited benefit expected in Q1.\nThe unexpected weather-related outage at our Arkansas mill, which caused lost production and repairs as well as natural gas price increases across our paperboard system, is expected to negatively impact the quarter by approximately $6 million to $8 million.\nIf our assumptions are correct, we anticipate first quarter adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $51 million to $59 million.\nThis range assumes we continue to operate our assets without significant COVID-related disruptions.\nWhile we are not prepared to provide specific annual guidance for 2021, there are several drivers, assumptions, and variables we would like to address.\nThe previously announced SBS price increases are expected to have a favorable effect.\nWe anticipate tissue volumes will decrease by high single to low double-digit percentages.\nThis prediction is based on the assumption that consumer purchasing habits will continue to normalize, but it heavily depends on how the pandemic progresses.\nOur sales pipeline appears promising and is expected to positively influence the latter half of the year.\nPaperboard volumes are predicted to remain relatively stable.\nWe foresee increased costs for inputs such as pulp, packaging, energy, and freight.\nWhile these factors are challenging to predict currently, the total impact of raw material inputs could be a $40 million to $50 million setback this year, with pulp accounting for more than half of this amount.\nIn our paperboard division, scheduled major maintenance shutdowns are projected to reduce our 2021 earnings by $25 million to $30 million compared to 2020.\nWe have revised this guidance on slide 23, breaking down the timing by quarter to reflect our current plan.\nIn response to the Cypress Bend weather event, we are reassessing the timing of our outage schedule and may provide updates in future quarters.\nFor the entire year of 2021, we also anticipate the following: interest expense between $38 million and $40 million.\nDepreciation is projected to be between $106 million and $110 million.\nCapital expenditures are expected to range from $60 million to $65 million, aligning more closely with historical trends as we plan to execute projects that were delayed in 2020.\nWe anticipate an effective tax rate of 25% to 26%, and we plan to use some of our current tax attributes, amounting to $60 million, to reduce cash taxes.\nSlide 13 provides an overview of our capital structure.\nWe used approximately $50 million of free cash flow to decrease our net debt, including making voluntary prepayments on our term loan, and our liquidity stood at $250 million at year-end.\nWe continue to make progress in reducing our net debt and enhancing our financial flexibility as we aim for a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.5 times, assuming adjusted EBITDA after COVID benefits and with a normal amount of outages.\nBefore concluding with our value proposition, I wanted to highlight some of our key achievements in 2020 on slide 14.\nOur team excellently managed the challenges posed by COVID.\nWe minimized risks in our facilities by prioritizing health and safety while continuing to operate our assets and serve our customers.\nWe swiftly adapted to demand fluctuations to strengthen customer relationships.\nWe successfully launched our new Shelby paper machine and are on track to fully ramp up the entire site by the end of this year.\nWe delivered exceptional financial results, reduced net debt by $200 million, refinanced our near-term debt maturities, and strengthened our balance sheet.\nSimultaneously, we underwent several leadership changes, including my promotion to CEO, hiring a new CFO, and appointing a new leader for our CPD business.\nIt was undoubtedly an eventful year, to say the least, and I'm proud of the numerous changes we implemented while maintaining high performance levels.\nWe believe we are well-positioned entering 2021 to continue improving our business and focusing on our near-term strategy of debt reduction while developing options for long-term capital allocation.\nI'd like to reemphasize our value proposition, which we discussed in our previous earnings call and mentioned to investors throughout the quarter.\nWe believe Clearwater Paper is well-positioned across two attractive and complementary businesses.\nOur Consumer Products division is a leader in the growing private branded tissue market.\nFrom our perspective, we believe the key strengths of this business are as follows: firstly, we have a national footprint with the ability to supply a wide range of product categories and quality tiers.\nThis is an attractive sales proposition for our customers.\nOur expertise in manufacturing, supply chain, and transportation is a key differentiator, especially during challenging times like today.\nSecondly, there are long-term trends shifting from branded products to private brands.\nThese trends have typically been amplified during economic downturns.\nPrivate brand tissue share in the U.S. increased to over 30% in 2019, up from 18% in 2011.\nWhile these trends are impressive, we're still far from the levels seen in many European countries where private brands represent over half of total tissue share.\nLastly, tissue is an economically resilient and essential product.\nHistorically, demand has not been negatively affected by economic uncertainty.\nRegarding our paperboard division, we believe the key strengths of this business are as follows: firstly, we operate well-invested assets with a geographic footprint that allows us to efficiently serve customers on both coasts.\nWe have a diverse customer base serving end markets with largely stable demand.\nSecondly, not being vertically integrated enables us to focus on independent customers with unparalleled service and quality commitments.\nThirdly, we believe the business is well-positioned to capitalize on trends towards more sustainable packaging and food service products.\nLastly, our paperboard business has demonstrated the ability to generate good margins and solid cash flows.\nOverall, our major capital investments are behind us, and we're prioritizing cash flows to reduce debt.\nAs we demonstrated in the fourth quarter, with a net debt reduction of approximately $58 million, bringing our net reduction in 2020 to over $200 million.\nWe intend to continue deleveraging by delivering benefits from our Shelby investment, continuing operational improvements, aggressively managing working capital, and prudently allocating capital.\nWhile we expect lower tissue shipments in the first part of the year, we're making sound strategic moves to support our customers and their success and continue to position our business for long-term success.\nWe believe this strategy is the best way to create shareholder value.\nWith an adjusted EBITDA impacted by normal outages and reduced COVID benefits, we do not anticipate achieving our 2.5 leverage target this year.\nWe continually engage with our Board on future capital allocations.\nBeyond deleveraging, we expect to explore various means of creating shareholder value, including: firstly, internal investments in our operations that improve competitiveness.\nSecondly, external investments that deliver synergies and improve our market position; and thirdly, returning capital to our shareholders.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:John Faucher, the Chief Investor Relations Officer, is speaking.\nThe actual outcomes may significantly deviate from these projections.\nI'll discuss our fourth quarter and annual results, as well as our 2021 forecast, before handing over to Noel to share his thoughts on maintaining our growth momentum in 2021.\nWe'll then commence the question and answer session.\nAs is customary, we kindly request that you stick to one question to allow as many participants as possible to inquire.\nWe concluded 2020 on a high note, achieving our highest quarterly organic sales growth in over a decade and our strongest annual organic sales growth since the financial crisis.\nNotably, we continue to achieve balanced growth, which we consider crucial for sustained strong performance.\nBoth the quarter and the year saw growth in volume and pricing, organic growth across all four of our divisions: oral care, personal care, home care, and pet nutrition, and organic sales growth in every division with strong performances in both emerging and developed markets.\nOur strategy to deliver more impactful premium innovation is in its early phases, but we believe the results are starting to become evident.\nSignificantly, this growth is positively impacting our income statement.\nWe achieved substantial gross margin expansion for both the quarter and the year, enabling us to deliver profitable growth despite significant investments for future growth and foreign exchange headwinds.\nOur net sales increased by 7.5% in the quarter.\nThe 8.5% organic sales growth was composed of 5% organic volume growth and a 3.5% price increase.\nAcquisitions contributed an additional 100 basis points to volume growth, while foreign exchange had a 2% negative impact.\nIn Q4, our gross profit margin was 61.1% on both a GAAP basis, up 100 basis points year-over-year, and a base business basis, up 90 basis points.\nFor Q4, pricing had a 130 basis point positive effect on gross margin, while raw materials had a 320 basis point negative impact due to increased costs of materials like fats and oils and the transactional impact of foreign exchange.\nProductivity provided a 280 basis point benefit.\nOn a GAAP basis, our SG&A increased by 260 basis points as a percentage of sales for Q4 and 100 basis points for the full year.\nOn a base business basis in Q4, our SG&A rose by 310 basis points as a percentage of sales.\nThis was primarily due to a 210 basis point increase in advertising to sales ratio as we heavily invested in brand building, innovation, and e-commerce.\nOur SG&A ratio was also affected by higher logistics costs, mainly in the U.S., and investments in growth and innovation.\nFor the full year on a base business basis, our SG&A ratio increased by 150 basis points, primarily due to a 100 basis point increase in advertising to sales ratio and higher logistics costs.\nFor Q4 on a GAAP basis, our operating profit grew by 4% year-over-year, while it increased by 3% on a base business basis.\nOur earnings per share remained flat on a GAAP basis but increased by 5% on a base business basis.\nFor the full year, our earnings per share growth was 14% on a GAAP basis and 8% on a base business basis.\nWe achieved 18% growth in free cash flow for the full year.\nAs discussed at the start of 2020, we used some of the free cash flow to reduce debt, primarily related to the Filorga transaction, with the remainder used for dividends and share repurchases.\nRegarding our divisional performance, North America achieved 10% net sales and 8.5% organic sales growth in the quarter, driven by premium innovation and increased consumption in categories affected by the COVID pandemic.\nWe also saw improved performance in our skin health businesses during the quarter.\nOur e-commerce business in North America ended the year strongly, with Q4 sales more than doubling compared to the previous year.\nNorth America significantly increased brand support for the hum by Colgate Electric Brush, the Colgate Optic White Overnight Teeth Whitening pen, our toothpaste business, and Irish Spring.\nLatin American net sales decreased slightly as double-digit organic sales growth was offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange.\nThe strong organic sales growth was widespread, with organic sales growth in every hub for both the quarter and the year.\nOral care innovation has been a key growth driver, with Colgate Tartar Control, Luminous White Charcoal, and our Natural Extracts line all contributing to incremental growth.\nEurope achieved double-digit net sales growth in the quarter.\nOrganic sales growth of 4.5% was driven by volume growth across all three segments - oral care, personal care, and home care - and in every hub.\nStrong oral care volume growth for the Colgate and elmex brands was accompanied by significant brand-building investment in traditional and digital media.\nFilorga experienced a return to organic growth, with strong performance in China offsetting weaknesses in travel retail.\nAsia Pacific saw 7% net sales and 5% organic sales growth, driven by volume increases in major markets like Greater China, India, the Philippines, and South Pacific.\nImproved toothpaste performance in India and China was achieved through strategic product launches and relaunches.\nPersonal care and home care products benefited from increased demand due to COVID-19 in the South Pacific region.\nDespite foreign exchange challenges, Africa/Eurasia achieved organic sales growth across all categories and hubs, although net sales declined 1.5%.\nColgate Herbal, Colgate Maxfresh, and Colgate Total led toothpaste organic sales growth.\nMeridol showed strong growth, aiming to increase market share in the pharmacy channel.\nHill's delivered another quarter of strong net sales and organic sales growth, despite challenging comparisons.\nThe US led organic sales growth, with e-commerce showing significant increases, while Europe achieved double-digit growth.\nThe Prescription Diet business is showing signs of recovery as veterinary channel traffic improves.\nOrganic sales growth is projected to be within the 3% to 5% long-term target range.\nForeign exchange is expected to provide a low-single-digit benefit for the year, though currency volatility may continue.\nNet sales are anticipated to increase by 4% to 7%.\nGross profit margin is expected to improve year-over-year in 2021, despite challenging comparisons and increased raw material costs.\nAdvertising expenditure as a percentage of sales is projected to increase, though less than in 2020.\nThe tax rate is estimated to be between 23.5% and 24.5% for both GAAP and base business.\nGAAP earnings-per-share growth is expected in the low-to-mid single digits.\nBase business earnings-per-share growth is anticipated in the mid-to-high single digits.\nThe wider guidance range reflects heightened uncertainty in planning for the year.\nSeveral factors could impact performance within this range, including changes in pandemic-related consumption patterns and foreign exchange movements in emerging markets.\nThe company is optimistic about pricing plans for 2021, considering recent raw material trends, competition, and foreign exchange.\nIncreased raw material costs are budgeted, but faster-than-anticipated price acceleration could pressure gross margin expansion.\nLogistics costs have risen, particularly in the US and for shipping containers in Asia, and are expected to remain high in the near term.\nThe company expresses hope for a return to normalcy over the course of the year.\nStan has joined the company and has quickly become involved in operations.\nThe company is proud of its employees' accomplishments in 2020.\nThree key topics guided crisis management: adhering to values and purpose, adapting strategies with agility, and planning for the future.\nEmployee safety measures were implemented while maintaining supply chain and laboratory operations, resulting in record output.\nSafeguarding Colgate employees' wellbeing remains our top concern, and we'll maintain this priority throughout 2021.\nThis year, we collaborated with the World Health Organization and local medical facilities to provide complimentary health and hygiene products worldwide, aiming to curb COVID's spread and enhance people's wellbeing, initiatives that Colgate staff take great pride in.\nIn the second area, we're implementing our growth-oriented strategy to achieve sustainable, lucrative expansion through more effective premium innovations, which will be elaborated on at CAGNY, enhancing our global brand development, and carrying out our digital transformation plan.\nAs John outlined, we accomplished this while delivering robust and balanced growth in organic net sales, net sales, operating profit, earnings per share, and free cash flow.\nWe managed to achieve these outcomes despite numerous operational challenges and a substantial negative impact from currency exchange rates.\nHowever, most crucially, while we've been meeting our 2020 targets, we've been intensely focused on setting ourselves up for growth in 2021 and beyond by capitalizing on our momentum, which was the third topic, navigating through this crisis with an eye on the future.\nNow I'll share some thoughts on why I believe our actions last year position us well to continue our growth trajectory in 2021 and beyond.\nThere are three reasons: firstly, as an organization, we've fundamentally altered our approach to growth.\nAs a company with leading brands, we must focus on driving category growth, which we can achieve in various ways.\nNaturally, we can increase our customer base, we can raise the price customers are willing to pay for our products, and we can boost the frequency of product usage.\nWe've enhanced existing tools and, importantly, developed new capabilities to drive this growth.\nFor example, with Hill's, we're reaching a broader consumer base through increased advertising to expand our reach and improving our digital targeting to raise brand awareness and household penetration for a truly differentiated brand.\nThis involves finding the right person with the right message at the right time.\nIt's not just about spending more, but spending more intelligently.\nIn Latin America, we've utilized revenue growth management tools to drive value with price/mix improvement in a challenging operating environment.\nFor instance, our share of the premium toothpaste segment in Brazil has grown by three points over the past two years, driven entirely by skillful and strategic revenue growth management.\nAs I discussed at the Barclays Conference, we've revamped our innovation processes to focus on breakthrough and transformational innovation, enabling us to increase the frequency of product usage and purchases.\nSuperior performance, new forms, delivery systems, and innovation for new channels all allow us to expand our availability to consumers so they can choose our products more frequently.\nGiven that the Colgate brand has the highest household penetration of any consumer brand globally, we have a unique ability to leverage our presence for faster growth.\nThe second reason is that we're developing a balanced approach to delivering profitable growth.\nWe recognize that to achieve a top-tier Total Shareholder Return among our peer group, we can't focus solely on top-line growth.\nWe need to deliver profitable growth.\nThis is evident in our 2020 results, where we achieved 8% earnings-per-share growth despite negative foreign exchange, while increasing brand building and investing in capabilities across the entire organization.\nWe're accomplishing this by leveraging all available tools: premium innovation, revenue growth management, funding growth, overhead discipline, and intense focus on all cost elements throughout the income statement.\nLooking ahead, we must do more than offset the expected increases in raw material costs, logistics, and other areas so we can continue investing in the transformation capabilities we're deploying, which will depend on more effectively pairing growth and productivity.\nThe third reason is that we're making necessary cultural changes to unleash the true potential of Colgate employees.\nAs anyone who has joined us from outside can attest, Colgate employees' desire to succeed is unparalleled.\nIn 2020, we took several steps to accelerate change and build an organization for future growth.\nTo that end, we made significant progress in e-commerce, bringing in more external talent while upskilling existing talent across the enterprise, launching more online-specific innovations like the Optic White pen and the Miracle Repair serum, and investing broadly in enhanced digital capabilities.\nThis all resulted in over 50% online growth in the fourth quarter, and we'll end the year with e-commerce at a double-digit run rate as a percentage of total sales.\nLastly, it's about building the right team.\nYou need to provide them with the right tools and technology to digitally transform the organization.\nWe continue to invest in systems to enable this transformation.\nOur transition to SAP S/4HANA is providing better system speed, improved reporting, streamlined processes, and simplified transactions.\nWe've developed our cloud capabilities, giving us greater agility, speed, and ability to develop applications faster and realize their value more quickly; and with our partners, we're supporting our data and analytics journey ahead.\nWe also recently implemented a new global system with our Colgate Business Planning process.\nYou'll recall this was called CBP, which will significantly reduce process time, providing greater opportunity for our teams to conduct analytics, particularly in the commercial area and especially around revenue growth management.\nIn conclusion, when I reflect on 2020 as a year where our company navigated through uncertainty to deliver strong results, I'll also view it as a year where we elevated our performance and capabilities, positioning ourselves to deliver sustainable, profitable growth in the future.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:To join the call online, please visit Capital One's website at capitalone.com and use the provided links.\nCapital One reported earnings of $3.3 billion or $7.03 per diluted common share in the first quarter.\nPre-provision earnings grew by 1% to $3.4 billion in the quarter, and we noted a provision benefit of $823 million.\nFollowing $535 million in gains from our Snowflake investment in 2021, we experienced a $75 million loss on our position in the first quarter, equivalent to $0.12 per share.\nWe have completely divested our position, resulting in a total gain of $460 million.\nOn Slide 4, I will provide a more detailed explanation of the quarterly allowance changes.\nWe released $1.6 billion of allowance in the first quarter.\nThe release was prompted by strong credit performance across all business segments and an improved economic outlook, including the $1.9 trillion stimulus package passed in March.\nOur allowance continues to assume that the connection between economic indicators and credit performance will return to historical trends.\nDespite improved credit performance and a more positive economic outlook, we maintain substantial qualitative factors to account for various remaining uncertainties.\nOn Slide 5, I will break down the allowance coverage by segment.\nFollowing the $1.6 billion allowance release, our coverage levels decreased slightly across all segments compared to the previous quarter but remain significantly higher than pre-pandemic levels.\nOur domestic card coverage is now 10.5%, down from 10.8% in the previous quarter.\nOur branded card coverage stands at 12.1%.\nThe difference between branded and domestic coverage is due to the loss-sharing agreement in our partnership portfolio.\nCoverage in our consumer business decreased by 38 basis points to 3.6%.\nCoverage in our commercial banking business dropped by 23 basis points to 2%.\nMoving to Slide 6, I will discuss liquidity.\nOur preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio for the first quarter was 139%, well above the 100% regulatory requirement.\nOur liquidity reserves from cash, securities, and federal home loan bank capacity ended the quarter at approximately $151 billion.\nThe $7 billion increase in total liquidity is primarily due to strong inflows of consumer and commercial deposits in the final weeks of the quarter.\nOn Slide 7, I will address our net interest margin.\nNIM decreased by six basis points compared to the previous quarter, mainly due to a 14-basis-point impact from having two fewer days in the quarter and a higher proportion of cash.\nThese factors were partially offset by the full quarter effect of deposit pricing actions taken in the fourth quarter and a slight increase in loan yields.\nLastly, on Slide 8, I will discuss our capital position.\nOur common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 14.6% at the end of the first quarter, an increase of 90 basis points from the fourth quarter and 260 basis points higher than a year ago.\nWe continue to estimate that our CET1 capital requirement is around 11%.\nIn January, our board of directors approved a repurchase plan of up to $7.5 billion of the company's common stock.\nWe repurchased $490 million of common stock in the first quarter at an average price of approximately $114 per share.\nDue to the Fed's extension of the trailing four-quarter average earnings rule, our share repurchase capacity will be limited to approximately $1.7 billion in the second quarter.\nThe timing and amount of future stock repurchase activities will depend on regulatory restrictions, stock trading volumes, and our overall view of our capital position.\nI'll start with Slide 10, which covers our credit card business.\nCredit card loan balances and revenue decreased year-over-year in the first quarter due to the ongoing effects of the pandemic.\nPurchase volume showed improvement compared to the first quarter of 2020.\nThe provision for credit losses, which saw significant improvement, was the primary factor influencing quarterly results.\nThe outcomes of the credit card segment are primarily determined by the performance and trends of our domestic card business, as illustrated on Slide 11.\nFor the third straight quarter, our domestic card business continues to exhibit two contrasting aspects of the same situation.\nUnusually high payment rates, intensified by government stimulus effects, continue to impact loan balances negatively.\nConversely, these same factors are resulting in exceptional credit performance.\nLet's first examine growth.\nWe observed a continued rebound in purchase volume from the sharp declines experienced early in the pandemic.\nIn the first quarter, domestic card purchase volume increased by 8.4% compared to the previous year, with growth accelerating in March.\nWhen compared to the first quarter of 2019, purchase volume has risen by 17%.\nMost spending categories now surpass the pre-pandemic levels observed in 2019.\nTravel and entertainment spending still lags behind pre-pandemic levels, but it's catching up.\nTravel and entertainment purchase volume is growing at a faster rate than overall purchase volume.\nThe historically high payment rate continues to put pressure on loan balances, despite the increase in consumer spending.\nAt the conclusion of the first quarter, domestic card ending loan balances had decreased by $18.5 billion, or approximately 17%, compared to the previous year.\nExcluding the impact of a partnership portfolio moved to held-for-sale last year, first-quarter ending loans declined by about 15% year over year.\nThe year-over-year percentage change in ending loan balances this quarter was roughly the same as the previous quarter.\nRemarkably strong credit performance was the main factor driving domestic card financial results in the quarter, as it had been for the two preceding quarters.\nThe domestic card charge-off rate for the quarter was 2.54%, showing a 214-basis-point improvement compared to the previous year.\nThe 30-plus delinquency rate at the end of the quarter was 2.24%, which is 145 basis points better than the prior year.\nThe provision for credit losses in the first quarter improved by nearly $4 billion compared to the same period last year.\nWe experienced a substantial allowance release in this year's first quarter, contrasting with a large allowance build in the first quarter of last year.\nRobust credit performance and purchase volume growth were also key factors in the domestic card revenue margin, which increased by 229 basis points year over year to 17.2%.\nTotal company marketing expenses increased slightly compared to the first quarter of 2020.\nOur decisions regarding card marketing are the primary influence on overall company marketing trends.\nDespite the ongoing pandemic, we're identifying opportunities to continue growing the business and maintaining our focus on marketing efforts.\nOverall, our domestic card business is generating significant value and gaining momentum.\nSlide 12 provides an overview of the first-quarter results for our consumer banking business.\nThe main themes in the first-quarter consumer banking results are continued growth in auto loans, strong performance in retail deposits, and exceptional auto credit.\nPrimarily due to auto loans, first-quarter ending loans in the consumer banking business increased by 10% compared to the previous year.\nAverage loans grew by 9%.\nAuto loan originations increased by 16% year over year and by 20% compared to the previous quarter.\nWe've observed an increase in competitive intensity during the second half of 2020 and in the first quarter of 2021.\nGiven that most competitors are holding excess deposits, we anticipate that competitive intensity will continue to rise in the future.\nFirst-quarter ending deposits in consumer banking increased by $36.4 billion, or 17%, compared to the previous year.\nThe average deposits experienced a 16% increase.\nCompared to the previous quarter, ending deposits grew by 2% while average deposits remained stable.\nThe year-over-year deposit growth is being driven by high consumer savings rates, which are fueled by ongoing government stimulus measures.\nConsumer banking revenue in the first quarter saw a 22% rise compared to the same period last year, primarily due to growth in auto loans and retail deposits.\nThe provision for credit losses in the first quarter showed a $986 million improvement year-over-year, mainly due to an allowance release and reduced charge-offs in the auto business.\nThe auto business is showing remarkably strong credit results, benefiting from historically high auction values and government stimulus.\nCompared to the previous year, the first-quarter charge-off rate improved by 104 basis points to 0.47%, while the delinquency rate improved by 217 basis points to 3.12%.\nA significant increase in used car values, along with a stimulus-driven increase in customer payments, led to a negative net charge-off rate in March.\nWe anticipate the auto charge-off rate to rise from its unusually low level as auction prices normalize and the effects of stimulus measures diminish.\nThe consumer banking division continues to show resilient growth in auto loans and retail deposits.\nLet's move on to Slide 13.\nI will now discuss our commercial banking operations.\nFirst-quarter ending loan balances decreased by 9% compared to the previous year.\nAverage loans declined by 3%.\nIn the C&I sector, we've observed a reduction in commercial line utilization, which reached its peak early in the pandemic when customers facing heightened uncertainty drew down their credit lines.\nThis behavior has since subsided.\nIn our commercial real estate division, originations decreased, and paydowns increased compared to the first quarter of 2020.\nQuarterly average deposits rose by 24% from the first quarter of 2020 and 4% from the previous quarter, as middle market and government clients continued to maintain high levels of liquidity.\nFirst-quarter revenue increased by 4% compared to the same period last year.\nHigher loan and deposit spreads and growth in average deposits were partially counterbalanced by lower average loan balances.\nThe provision for credit losses showed significant improvement compared to the first quarter of 2020, driven by a shift from an allowance build to an allowance release and reduced net charge-offs.\nFor the first quarter, the commercial banking annualized charge-off rate was nine basis points.\nThe criticized performing loan rate was 9.2%, while the criticized nonperforming loan rate was 0.9%.\nOur commercial banking division is delivering robust performance as we continue to navigate the pandemic and enhance our commercial capabilities.\nI'll conclude tonight by sharing some thoughts on our results and strategic position.\nThree key themes are evident in our first-quarter results.\nHigh payment rates continue to exert short-term pressure on loan balances and revenue growth, particularly in our domestic card business.\nOn the other hand, remarkably strong credit led to a third consecutive quarter of record earnings per share.\nOur investments in transforming our technology and work processes are yielding positive results.\nOur modern technology is driving our response to the pandemic and positioning us strongly for opportunities that arise as sweeping digital changes transform the banking industry.\nTaking a broader perspective, we continue to focus on elements that create lasting value when delivered and maintained over the long term, including ongoing transformation of our technology from the ground up, leveraging our transformation to drive innovation and growth, generating positive operating leverage and improving efficiency over time, and managing capital efficiently and effectively, including significant planned capital distribution.\nWe will now begin the Q&A session.\nTo be considerate of other investors and analysts who may want to ask questions, please limit yourself to one question and a single follow-up.\nIf you have additional questions after the Q&A session, the investor relations team will be available following the call.\nKeith, please initiate the Q&A.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:We are grateful for your presence today as we discuss our Q1 2021 results.\nWe released our quarterly financial report yesterday.\nOur robust financial performance demonstrates continued growth and effective operations, while serving customers, finalizing new investments, and prioritizing employee safety.\nJoining me on this call are Jeff Householder, our President and CEO, and Jim Moriarty, our Executive VP, General Counsel, Corporate Secretary and Chief Policy and Risk Officer, as shown on Slide 2.\nAdditional management team members are participating remotely.\nWe've begun 2021 strongly with profitable growth across our business segments.\nSlide 4 shows our earnings per share from continuing operations reached $1.96, a 10.7% or $0.19 increase compared to $1.77 in Q1 2020.\nOur gross margin grew by over $17 million compared to the first quarter of last year.\nGrowth across all company divisions drove our results.\nWe also saw higher consumer usage due to weather conditions more in line with typical temperatures.\nKey factors contributing to our margin growth included pipeline expansions, the Hurricane Michael regulatory agreement, organic growth in natural gas distribution customers, contributions from recent acquisitions, increased propane retail margins, and growth in Marlin Gas Services.\nAs our General Counsel Jim Moriarty often notes, we benefit from our geographical positioning.\nWe are fortunate to serve rapidly growing communities with our energy delivery services.\n[Technical difficulties] initiatives indicating support for further expansion of our Florida systems.\nDemand for natural gas, propane, and electricity is at an all-time high in all our service areas.\nWe continue to add customers at more than double the national average rate.\nIn the last year, our utility distribution and customer base grew by 7.4%.\nThe main driver of our Q1 capital investment was growth opportunities to serve new customers.\nWe're on track to meet our projected 2021 capital investments of about $200 million.\nOur first quarter capital expenditure totaled just under $49 million.\nOur Board of Directors approved an annual dividend of $1.92 per share earlier today, a 9.1% or $0.16 per share increase.\nAs shown on Slide 5, this $0.16 increase in the annual dividend aligns closely with our five-year earnings growth rate of 9.4% through December 31, 2020, and our five-year dividend growth rate of 9.5%, including this latest increase.\nThe Board's decision to raise the dividend reflects our ongoing commitment to dividend growth supported by earnings growth, while maintaining a payout ratio that allows for reinvestment in growth and ensures operational liquidity.\nChesapeake Utilities has consistently paid dividends for 60 years and has increased its annual dividend every year since 2004.\nI'll discuss our ongoing growth initiatives and capital investment projects across our business units shortly.\nSlide 6 shows our net income from continuing operations for the quarter was $34.5 million, compared to $29 million for the same period last year, representing a growth of $5.5 million or about 19%.\nAs you may recall, we exited the natural gas marketing business in Q4 2019, recognizing gains from those sales.\nThere were minor lingering effects from this business sale in both 2020 and Q1 2021.\nTherefore, I'll focus our discussion today primarily on continuing operations.\nEPS from continuing operations for Q1 grew by $0.19 to $1.96 per share from $1.77, a growth of nearly 11% compared to Q1 last year.\nGrowth initiatives and customer consumption drove the 19% increase in net income, while the 11% EPS growth reflects the significant equity we issued in Q3 and Q4 2020 through the ATM program and various stock plans.\nHigher income resulted from improved performance across the company, as Jeff mentioned earlier, along with continued expense management, business efficiencies, and standardization and collaboration across the organization.\nGross margin increased 17.1% compared to Q1 last year, while operating income grew by 22.5% due to these factors.\nAs Slide 7 highlights, the growth in operating income was fairly evenly split between the Regulated Energy and Unregulated Energy segments for the quarter.\nSlide 8 outlines the key drivers of gross margin and expenses for Q1 compared to Q1 last year.\nGross margin net of specific expense attributes grew $0.65 per share after tax.\nHigher earnings for the quarter reflect increased earnings across the business from various factors.\nThese increases were offset by the absence of property sales from Q1 last year, representing $0.14 per share, and the increased shares we added, another $0.12 per share, given our opportunistic equity issuances over the past 12 months to capitalize on our strong equity market position.\nFinally, depreciation, payroll, and facilities expenses reduced our earnings per share by $0.20 due to business growth.\nI'd like to discuss our capital spending so far in 2021.\nAs shown on Slide 9, our 2021 capital expenditure forecast remains at our previously announced guidance of $175 million to $200 million.\nApproximately 80% of the investment is budgeted for new regulated energy assets.\nYear-to-date, as Jeff mentioned, we've invested just under $49 million in new capital investments.\nSome key 2021 projects include our Delmarva Natural Gas Distribution expansion into Somerset County, Eastern Shore's Del-Mar Energy Pathway project, Florida's Western Palm Beach County expansion, our Florida GRIP program, and other natural gas distribution and transmission system projects.\nWe also have expenditures for infrastructure improvements, Marlin Gas Services expansion, and technology systems supporting our business transformation and other strategic initiatives.\nTo support our growth and ensure capital capacity for future growth, we maintain a strong balance sheet with access to sufficient competitively priced capital.\nSlide 10 shows that as of the end of March, our total capitalization was $1.4 billion, comprised of approximately 52% stockholders' equity at $726 million, 37% in long-term debt at an average fixed rate of 3.62%, and $156 million in short-term debt under our revolver at an average interest rate of 1.2%.\nOur recent equity issuance moved this further along within our target equity to total capitalization range.\nWe continue to use our traditional equity plans this year to issue stock and increase equity beyond our retained earnings reinvested in the business.\nChesapeake Utilities' current market capitalization is approximately $2 billion.\nAs Beth noted, our capital capacity and balance sheet strength continue to support growth.\nWe're confident that our previously updated capital guidance remains on target.\nSlide 11 reminds us of the key strategic initiatives guiding our project development and transaction interests from earlier earnings calls.\nAs I mentioned earlier, we continue to see significant demand for energy services provided by our existing business units.\nLet me highlight a few of our major initiatives on Slide 12.\nA large part of planned capital investment is allocated to growing our primary business areas.\nSeveral small-scale pipeline projects are in development, potentially increasing investment in this sector.\nOur propane business is expanding and we'll continue seeking acquisition opportunities in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast regions.\nWe anticipate growth in Marlin Gas Services and the emerging renewable natural gas market, which I'll elaborate on shortly.\nThis margin table displays key projects and initiatives, including pipeline expansion, CNG, RNG transportation, acquisitions, and regulatory efforts, as shown on Slide 13.\nMajor projects are predicted to yield approximately $60 million and $67 million in gross margin for 2021 and 2022, respectively.\nPipeline expansions are expected to generate an additional $6.7 million in margin in 2021.\nThe Hurricane Michael proceeding settlement will again produce $11 million in gross margin in 2021, remaining at that level in 2022.\nWe're pleased with the complete integration of margin estimates of $5.8 million and $6.1 million for 2021 and 2022, respectively, from the Elkton Gas and Western Natural Gas acquisitions.\nIn total, the additional margin growth from these key projects and initiatives amounts to about $14.1 million for 2021 and $7.5 million for 2022.\nWe only include definitive projects in this table once they're fully developed, and don't include organic margin growth from our traditional distribution, customer additions, rate adjustments in our unregulated businesses, and so on.\nAs such, the RNG transportation margin will be updated as new projects become definite and are announced.\nWe've included a $1 million placeholder for RNG transportation on the slide for a few quarters, without yet disclosing the extent of anticipated RNG production-related investments.\nThese projects require significant time to develop, particularly in securing full project financing.\nThis situation reminds me of the early stages of solar and wind project financing.\nHowever, RNG project financing is gaining momentum as interest grows among both financial and strategic participants, and we hope to make more details of our involved projects public in the coming weeks.\nThe Auburndale Pipeline ($679,000) and Boulden acquisition ($3.9 million) became fully operational in 2020, so these mature projects have been removed from this table.\nIn recent quarters, we've outlined several renewable natural gas initiatives.\nSlide 14 presents the types of projects and ownership structures we're actively considering.\nLet me update you on our progress for several of these initiatives.\nWe're continuing to collaborate with CleanBay renewables on two large-scale poultry waste, RNG and organic fertilizer production facilities on the Delmarva Peninsula.\nWe previously mentioned our agreement with CleanBay to own the gas processing equipment at the Westover Maryland facility, with an option to convert the equipment investment to equity in the entire plant.\nLast month, our Board Investment Committee authorized management to negotiate economic and governance terms with CleanBay regarding Chesapeake's equity participation in the project.\nWe aim to finalize an agreement with CleanBay and other equity providers soon, ensuring that the projected Q4 2023 in-service date remains feasible.\nBesides the Westover RNG facility, we're discussing with CleanBay and other potential investors about a second Delmarva RNG facility under development in Sussex County, Delaware.\nLike the Westover plant, the Sussex facility will produce large-scale RNG along with organic fertilizer.\nThe property for the Sussex plant has been acquired and most land use permits have been approved.\nOnce completed, the Westover and Sussex plants will be among the largest RNG facilities nationwide.\nWe have several additional investments either under contract or in final negotiations related to the Westover plant.\nThe Marlin Gas Transport agreement is in place, an interconnect agreement with our Eastern Shore Natural Gas transmission pipeline has been finalized, and the interconnect is scheduled for construction to coincide with the Westover plant's in-service date.\nOur Delmarva distribution business has finalized an agreement to purchase non-fossil RNG molecules from Westover for distribution to our customers.\nIn addition to buying RNG from Westover's production, our Delmarva distribution operations will provide conventional gas supply service to Westover to support the organic fertilizer production at the plant.\nWestover is likely to become our largest Maryland gas distribution customer.\nEastern Shore Natural Gas Del-Mar Energy Pathway expansion project, currently under construction, and our related distribution system expansion will bring our pipelines within 1.5 miles of the Westover plant, and we'll extend the distribution system to provide service.\nWe expect to provide similar Marlin and conventional gas distribution services to the CleanBay Sussex site.\nChesapeake is exploring opportunities to develop renewable electric micro-grids at both the Westover and Sussex RNG sites.\nWe're working with a third party to potentially develop solar photovoltaic generation systems to meet the electric needs of the RNG facilities.\nProperty suitable for solar PV installation is owned by the third party near the Westover site, and by Chesapeake close to the Sussex site.\nChesapeake has engaged Southern Company Energy Services and Southern's PowerSecure Company to assist in preliminary design and engineering of the solar PV systems, battery storage, protection protocols for the plants and related facilities to support a renewable electric micro-grid at each facility.\nOn Delmarva, we continue to work with Bioenergy DevCo as they progress on developing a poultry waste RNG facility in Sussex County, Delaware.\nThe County Commission has recently approved Bioenergy DevCo's conditional land use permit.\nChesapeake will own and operate the gas processing equipment at the plant site.\nWe've ordered the processor, hired an EPC contractor, and are finalizing design on various other components.\nOur investment in the project is estimated at about $12 million, with service expected to begin in late 2022.\nConstruction of our Savannah public compressed natural gas vehicle fueling and Marlin staging facility is proceeding on schedule for an October 2021 launch.\nThe station will be the largest CNG fueling facility on the East Coast, capable of fueling approximately 185 semi-trucks daily.\nWe recently met with representatives from several Georgia-based trucking firms, where interest in CNG was high and interest in potentially providing renewable CNG at that facility was even higher.\nWe're collaborating with several RNG marketers and exploring opportunities to develop regional CNG production to serve the Savannah station.\nRegarding Marlin, we're concluding an eight-month deployment serving the City of Miami transit bus fleet.\nAt peak, we were fueling 160 CNG buses daily before the permanent pipeline and CNG fueling facilities were installed.\nMarlin CNG Service enabled early delivery of the buses and an earlier than anticipated significant reduction in diesel emissions.\nMarlin has also received its new four-stage compressor unit.\nThe compressor allows Marlin to offer a methane capture service to pipelines and utilities that need to remove a pipeline segment for maintenance or system integrity work.\nInstead of releasing methane into the atmosphere, Marlin can receive the gas at almost any line pressure, compress it to CNG pressures, and transfer it to a tanker.\nThe gas can then be reintroduced at another point in the pipeline system.\nMarlin has also received its first four LNG tankers.\nThe increased LNG transport capacity provides an expanded range of services for customers requiring larger gas quantities.\nWe are continuing to convert our fleet at Marlin from diesel fuel to compressed natural gas.\nIn July, we will receive eight new tractor cabs that run on compressed natural gas.\nDuring our previous quarterly call, I noted our involvement in a hydrogen research project submitted to the Department of Energy by Solar Turbines.\nWe have proposed using our Eight Flags CHP turbine on Amelia Island as a testing location and are collaborating with several of our current industrial clients to explore opportunities for hydrogen blends at their sites.\nWe are in the early stages of learning about hydrogen usage, including safety considerations, operational impacts, measurement methods, availability, and effects on downstream customer equipment.\nIt's a pleasure to be here with you all today.\nI'd like to start by updating you on some recent legislative developments in Florida.\nAs illustrated on Slide 15, the energy pre-emption bill is crucial legislation that preserves consumer choice and ensures the continued availability of natural gas as an affordable, dependable, and resilient energy source.\nNatural gas will be accessible to meet growing customer needs.\nFurthermore, we backed a renewable energy bill that has passed both chambers of the Florida Legislature and awaits the governor's signature.\nThis legislation defines biogas and renewable natural gas.\nIt encourages the use of RNG in transportation, electricity generation, and injection into gas distribution networks.\nThe bill also allows the PSC to approve cost recovery for RNG contracts that exceed market rates under specific circumstances.\nOnce signed by the governor, Florida will join twelve other states in recognizing the important role of natural gas in meeting the nation's growing energy demands.\nWe are pleased with our governmental affairs team's efforts in driving and supporting such important legislation in Florida to ensure natural gas availability for customer demand and to provide a mechanism for renewable natural gas to become a viable part of the state's natural gas portfolio.\nWe are at various stages of working on similar legislation in our other jurisdictions and will keep you informed of future developments.\nAs shown on Slide 16, Chesapeake Utilities continues to build upon our fundamental commitment to ESG, focusing on environmental stewardship, dedication to social justice, and sound governance principles.\nOur recognition as a top workplace for nine consecutive years in the areas we serve, as well as our recognition in the inaugural top workplace awards, speaks volumes about our diverse and inclusive culture, which continues to foster employee growth and development and active community engagement.\nRobust corporate governance has been crucial in creating long-term value and upholding our commitments to all stakeholders.\nOur Board and its committees have adopted guidelines and policies that provide a framework for ongoing effective governance.\nActive and informed engagement, which is ingrained in our people from the Board of Directors throughout the Company, is essential as we continue to chart our future course together.\nStrong corporate governance also involves listening to our stockholders and monitoring annual vote results.\nThis year's results show that over 90% of the votes cast were in favor of the proposals presented, demonstrating our stockholders' continued strong support for the Company's performance and future strategy.\nOur commitment to operating safely and in an environmentally friendly manner furthers our stewardship and promotes sustainable practices across our organization.\nOur team, with input from the Board of Directors, discusses key risks and mitigating factors identified as part of our comprehensive Enterprise Risk Management program.\nESG-related focus areas and emerging risks are integrated into our ERM program.\nRegarding safety, as shown on Slide 17, we are dedicated to providing a safe workplace for employees and prioritizing safety in our interactions with each other, our customers, and the communities we serve.\nAchieving superior safety performance is a critical strategic initiative, both in the short and long term.\nSafety is not only our top priority and first strategic objective, but it is also central to our identity.\nOne of our recent accomplishments in this area is the completion of our safety town facility in Dover, Delaware, which provides hands-on and classroom training for our operations technicians.\nWe are also diligently working on our inaugural Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability report, to be released in 2021, which will provide additional information and insights on our long-standing ESG stewardship.\nWe are committed to fostering a work environment that values the diversity of backgrounds, experiences, and skills of all our employees, as highlighted on Slide 18.\nIn continuing our fundamental commitment to equity, diversity, and inclusion, our Equity, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) Council supports all our employees, encouraging them to share their diverse experiences and backgrounds with the goal of improving the communities we serve and making us a better company.\nThe EDI Council is integral to our identity and aspirations, and we will further enhance collaboration around our workplace culture that drives our business.\nThe EDI Council was extremely active in 2020, facilitating the launch of five employee resource groups throughout the Company, as shown on Slide 18.\nWe are enthusiastic about these teams' accomplishments in a short time and look forward to their increasing role and the creation of additional ERGs.\nThe talent, skills, and ideas that these groups have brought to the forefront have been inspiring and provide channels for our employees to feel included and supported by the Company.\nWe strive daily to ensure that the communities we serve continue to receive the benefits of clean, abundant, affordable, and resilient energy delivery services, so that no one is left behind.\nWe continue to take various internal actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, including completing our pipeline replacement program and implementing improved detection technology at our compressor stations.\nWe are also collaborating with our suppliers and contractors to encourage their environmental efforts.\nWe are excited about ongoing projects by our diverse and engaged teams to reduce the carbon footprint of the communities we serve, including conservation programs that promote high-efficiency appliances and technical assistance for large volume customers to identify emission reduction opportunities.\nWe remain committed to taking necessary steps to deliver energy where and when needed while advancing our environmental stewardship.\nOur announced projects in renewable natural gas (RNG) are just the beginning.\nThey clearly demonstrate our efforts to lower the carbon footprint and ensure a more sustainable future for our local communities.\nWhile we're starting fiscal year 2021 with strong financial performance, as evidenced by our earnings-per-share growth, capital investments, key projects and initiatives, and dividend growth, as shown on Slides 19 and 20, we're confirming our five-year capital guidance for 2021 to 2025 at $750 million to $1 billion.\nI'm pleased that our latest strategic plan update gives us high confidence in significant future investment opportunities.\nThis confidence in our growth prospects has allowed us to extend and expand our capital guidance.\nOur 2025 earnings per share guidance range of $6.05 to $6.25 represents an average earnings per share growth of approximately 10% since we initiated guidance at the end of 2017.\nWe believe natural gas is a crucial component of the country's long-term energy strategy.\nWe also believe that the markets we serve value the energy services we provide, whether it's natural gas, propane, or electricity, as our customers have clearly indicated.\nAt the same time, given our business mix, expertise, and strategic approach, we have opportunities to capitalize on new renewable energy prospects that move us toward a more sustainable future.\nWe're committed to our growth strategy.\nWe focus on delivering top-quartile performance, including shareholder returns, which have exceeded 16% compound annual growth for each period of one, three, five, 10, and 20 years through April 30, 2021.\nOur investment proposition is based on a commitment to superior performance, as outlined on Slide 21.\nOur foundation, financial objectives and targets, as well as the initiatives and strategies we pursue, support achieving this level of performance.\nWe take great pride in the work done on the front lines and our ongoing commitment to identifying and delivering innovative solutions for providing clean, reliable, and safe energy to our customers.\nWe are now ready to address any questions you may have.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Carter's is experiencing a recovery from pandemic-related market disruptions.\nThe company achieved its highest-ever gross profit margin in the quarter through improved pricing and more focused promotions.\nExpenditures and inventory levels were reduced below those of the previous year.\nThe company enhanced cash flow and liquidity while gaining market share during the quarter.\nBusiness trends in July started positively, with sales reaching over 90% of the previous year's levels.\nNearly all stores were operational before the July 4th weekend, with retail sales during that holiday period increasing by 7% compared to the previous year.\nIn August, sales decreased to about 87% of the previous year's levels due to delayed school reopenings.\nThe shift to virtual learning at home reduced the need for back-to-school clothing purchases.\nSeptember was the most significant month of the year so far in terms of sales and earnings contributions.\nSeptember sales reached 95% of the previous year's levels.\nThis performance is the strongest since the pandemic's impact began in March.\nLabor Day holiday sales were the best in three years, with comparable retail sales increasing by 15% during that period.\nOctober sales are trending above 90% of the previous year's levels.\nThe company continues to see strong demand for its baby apparel and sleepwear products.\nBaby apparel and sleepwear accounted for approximately 70% of total apparel sales.\nThe company holds five times the market share of its nearest competitors in these product categories.\nPlaywear sales improved in July as families prepared for the new school year.\nSales declined in August when it became clear schools wouldn't reopen, but rebounded in September as consumers shopped for cooler weather clothing.\nThe company introduced its Little Baby Basics product line in late June to coincide with store reopenings.\nThis core baby product offering is the best-selling newborn apparel in the United States.\nThe Little Baby Basics line is a high-margin replenishment program and one of the company's most successful recent launches.\nReplenishment trends since the launch have been significantly better than the previous year.\nIn the third quarter, retail sales improved to 97% of the same period last year.\nThis recovery in sales was the strongest compared to the Wholesale and International segments.\nThe pandemic has accelerated the shift towards online purchases.\nStore operation hours were reduced by over 20% in the quarter due to fewer store visits.\nOn a per-hour basis, store sales were better than the previous year.\nDespite lower store traffic, conversion rates and units purchased per transaction increased.\nThese improved metrics are believed to reflect strong product offerings, compelling value, and high-quality service from store associates.\nStores that typically benefited from tourism, including international visitors, experienced the largest decline in traffic.\nThese stores represent about 11% of U.S. locations but accounted for approximately 40% of the decline in comparable sales for the quarter.\nThese stores are likely to underperform others until tourism and cross-border travel return to pre-pandemic levels.\nDue to the mix and level of eCommerce inventories, the company was less promotional than the previous year.\nThis resulted in significantly improved price realization and eCommerce profitability for the quarter.\nSimilar to in-store experiences, online demand from international customers continues to trend lower than the previous year.\nThe largest declines in demand were from Brazil, Argentina, and Europe.\nThese markets have historically been among the best sources of international demand on U.S. websites.\nThese markets were particularly affected by the pandemic and a stronger dollar.\nThe company continues to benefit from significant investments made in recent years to enhance the online shopping experience.\nIn the third quarter, stores fulfilled 24% of eCommerce orders.\nThe company has invested in technology to optimize profitability and delivery speed for these purchases.\nTo improve shopping convenience, same-day pickup and curbside pickup services are now offered at over 600 U.S. stores.\nThese new omni-channel services are more profitable than shipping from distribution centers to consumers' homes.\nOmni-channel customers, who use both online and in-store services, are the highest value customers, spending more than twice as much as single-channel customers annually.\nThe company expects stores to play an important role in supporting eCommerce customers in the future.\nCurrently, about 85% of U.S. stores are located in open-air centers, which is believed to provide an advantage over mall-based competitors.\nOpen-air centers offer a more convenient experience for same-day pickup and curbside pickup of online purchases.\nThe company plans to continue opening stores in densely populated areas and close stores in more remote and declining centers.\nThe plan is to open fewer than 100 co-branded stores over the next five years.\nThe company also plans to close about 25% of its stores as leases expire.\nNearly 60% of these closures may occur by the end of next year.\n80% of the planned closures are expected to be completed by the end of 2022.\nThe stores slated for closure are generally older, lower-margin locations in declining centers that are less likely to support the focus on high-value omni-channel customers.\nCarter's is considered an attractive tenant in shopping centers.\nThe company's brands are viewed as traffic drivers, bringing families with young children into shopping centers.\nAs other retailers struggle and downsize, new and more attractive real estate opportunities become available.\nIt's currently a buyer's market, and the company plans to pursue better opportunities in improved centers that offer convenience for consumers and high returns for shareholders.\nThe Wholesale business also showed good progress in recovering from earlier store closures.\nThird-quarter sales were about 86% of the previous year's sales.\nThe operating margin on these sales was better than the previous year.\nIn the third quarter, the company experienced growth with three of its top five wholesale customers.\nThe company continues to see good growth with its exclusive brands, with sales collectively up 10%.\nE-commerce demand for the company's brands through wholesale customers increased by over 40% in the third quarter, including triple-digit growth rates for some exclusive brands.\nThe trend in online demand improved each month during the quarter.\nCombined with wholesale customers, online purchases of the company's brands are up over 50% year-to-date.\nThe company expects to achieve a new milestone within the next few weeks, with annual online purchases of its brands exceeding $1 billion this year.\nCarter's brand wholesale sales were down about 25% in the quarter, due to retailers cautiously planning for second-half sales and the company's decision to curtail fall and holiday inventory commitments.\nMost wholesale customers have lean inventories, seeing better sell-throughs, higher margins, and are in a chase mode given better-than-expected demand for the company's brands.\nGiven pandemic-related uncertainty in consumer demand, operating with leaner inventories is considered a better strategy through the balance of the year, even if it results in fewer sales.\nThe decision to run lean on inventories may impact second-half wholesale sales by up to $50 million, or less than 3% of total second-half sales.\nOne benefit of running leaner inventories this year is fewer low-margin sales to off-price retailers.\nSales to off-price retailers were down 18% in the quarter and over 50% year-to-date.\nThe company used its stores and websites in the U.S. and Canada to sell through excess inventories caused by store closures and related wholesale order cancellations earlier in the year.\nThis strategy allowed the company to offer consumers compelling value through its stores and websites while avoiding losses that would have been incurred by selling excess inventory to off-price retailers.\nInternational sales in the quarter were about 90% of the previous year's sales and contributed over 13% of total company sales, comparable to the previous year.\nThe strength of the International segment is in the direct-to-consumer business, which represented over two-thirds of international sales in the quarter.\nThe company saw high single-digit growth in retail sales, driven by a nearly 70% increase in eCommerce sales in Canada and Mexico.\nMany of the company's international wholesale relationships are with smaller retailers representing its brands worldwide.\nThese retailers have historically been a good source of sales and profitability but have been particularly affected by the pandemic, stronger dollar, and other local market challenges.\nSales to these wholesale customers are expected to be the slowest to recover from the global pandemic.\nFor context, these customers contributed less than 2% of the company's annual sales in 2019.\nWe anticipate improved performance from our global retailers, such as Walmart, Costco and Amazon.\nThe expansion of our Simple Joys brand in Europe over the past year has yielded positive results for Amazon.\nThis should provide us with a significant growth opportunity in the coming years.\nOur team did an outstanding job collaborating with our suppliers to minimize our exposure to excess inventory in our supply chain.\nCompared to last year, inventories at the end of September were reduced by more than 10%.\nAs we informed you in July, we are experiencing delays in receiving products from Asia.\nWe believe these delays were caused by carriers reducing capacity earlier this year when demand decreased due to store closures.\nThe delays also reflect insufficient capacity to handle the surge in demand when stores reopened this summer and the precautions being taken to protect manufacturing and transportation workers from the coronavirus.\nThey have been very understanding and recognize that the delays are a result of market disruption.\nAs we approach the holiday season, the flow of products has improved, and we do not anticipate shipping delays to significantly impact fourth quarter sales.\nWe are also managing our exposure to freight surcharges imposed by inbound and outbound carriers due to the increase in eCommerce sales and limited capacity.\nOur best analysis suggests these surcharges may affect fourth quarter earnings by approximately $2 million.\nOur supply chain team has negotiated lower product costs for spring 2021 due to reduced input costs and excess manufacturing capacity in Asia.\nDemand for that product line is expected to be similar to last year, with related shipments beginning later this quarter.\nIn conclusion, we are making good progress in recovering from the disruption caused by the pandemic.\nWe have endured an exceptionally challenging market this past year, with unprecedented store closures, record unemployment, and a highly contagious and deadly virus.\nWe anticipate that the path forward will be challenging.\nHowever, we believe we have a strong product offering and effective marketing strategies as we enter the final weeks of the year.\nIt is uncertain how long the market disruption will persist.\nWhat we do know is that the inherent strength of our brands and business model should help us continue to navigate through these difficult times.\nWe hold the largest market share in children's apparel in the United States and Canada, with twice the share of our nearest competitors.\nChildren's clothing is considered a less discretionary purchase.\nWe concentrate on essential core products that are bought in multiple quantities on a frequent basis during the early years of a child's life.\nOur average price points are under $10, offering excellent value to consumers in a weaker economic climate.\nWe are the largest supplier of children's apparel to the biggest retailers in the United States.\nWe are also the largest children's apparel specialty retailer with one of the strongest and most profitable eCommerce platforms in the industry.\nI am thankful for their dedication to enhancing our brands and meeting the needs of families with young children.\nIn the coming months, we will update our growth plans based on our experiences this year.\nAccording to our current projections, we are planning for significant growth in sales and earnings next year.\nI will start on Page 2 with our GAAP income statement for the third quarter.\nAs Mike mentioned, our third quarter results significantly exceeded our expectations.\nNet sales for the quarter were $865 million, an 8% decrease from last year.\nReported operating income was $114 million, a 35% increase.\nReported earnings per share were $1.85 compared to $1.34 a year ago, representing 38% growth.\nOur third quarter and year-to-date results for both 2020 and 2019 included unusual items, which we have detailed on Page 3.\nWe have treated these items as non-GAAP adjustments to our reported results to allow for better comparison.\nMy comments today will address our results on an adjusted basis, excluding these unusual items.\nMoving to Page 4 and our adjusted P&L for the third quarter.\nNet sales decreased 8% to $865 million, which is a substantial improvement over the 30% decline we experienced in the second quarter.\nWe continue to see strong online demand with our U.S. eCommerce business achieving a 17% comp and eCommerce comps in Canada increasing by nearly 60%.\nWhile gross profit dollars declined 5% due to lower sales, gross margin rate improved by 180 basis points compared to last year, reaching 44.4%.\nThis represented a record quarterly gross margin and was driven by improved price realization and continued progress in reducing excess inventory.\nRoyalty income was approximately the same as last year at $9 million.\nSpending was very well managed during the quarter.\nAdjusted SG&A decreased by $24 million or 8% across various expense categories.\nAdjusted operating income grew 4% to $120 million and adjusted operating margin expanded 160 basis points to 13.8%, driven by our strong gross margin performance and effective management of spending.\nBelow the line, we had higher net interest expense than last year due to the $500 million in new senior notes we issued earlier this year.\nWe had other income of approximately $3 million in the quarter, primarily from foreign currency gains.\nOur effective tax rate was about 19% in the quarter, up from about 18% last year.\nAverage share count declined 2%, driven by share repurchases in 2019.\nRemember that we suspended share repurchases earlier this year as part of our liquidity improvement initiatives.\nIn summary, adjusted earnings per share grew 5% to $1.96, up from $1.87 last year.\nTurning to Page 5 with some balance sheet and cash flow highlights.\nOur balance sheet and liquidity remain very strong.\nTotal liquidity at the end of the third quarter was nearly $1.6 billion, with over $800 million in cash on hand and almost all of the borrowing capacity under our $750 million credit facility available to us.\nGiven the uncertainty of the current environment, we believe that having substantial liquidity, as we clearly do, is a strategic advantage for Carter's.\nAs Mike mentioned, we ended the quarter with inventories 11% lower than a year ago.\nWe believe the overall quality of our inventory is high.\nWe've made good progress in reducing excess inventory, although we're still working through some excess spring product, particularly in our stores.\nWe're currently planning for net inventories at the end of the year to be roughly comparable with a year ago.\nOur Q3 accounts receivable balance declined 10% compared to last year, reflecting lower wholesale sales.\nAccounts payable were $473 million at quarter-end compared to $206 million a year ago.\nThis increase reflects the successful extension of payment terms and rent deferrals.\nWe continue to receive strong support from our vendors and landlords as we collectively manage through the disruptions caused by the pandemic.\nLong-term debt was $1 billion, up from $770 million in the third quarter of last year, which reflects our successful senior notes financing transaction in May and lower revolver borrowings.\nIn the third quarter, we repaid $244 million, which represented all of the outstanding borrowings under our credit facility.\nConsidering our significant cash position, net debt at the end of the third quarter was $158 million compared to over $600 million at the end of Q3 last year.\nBased on our current outlook, we believe we will have ample liquidity for the foreseeable future as our business continues to recover from the pandemic.\nDespite year-to-date net income being lower than last year, our operating cash flow was very strong at $320 million compared to $73 million last year.\nThis increase reflects improved working capital, including lower inventory and the successful extension of vendor payment terms, which I've described.\nTurning to Page 7 with a summary of our business segment results for the third quarter.\nWhile sales were down, profitability in each of our business segments improved in the third quarter, and our consolidated adjusted operating margin expanded by 160 basis points over last year.\nTurning to Page 8, with third quarter results for our U.S. retail segment.\nTotal segment sales declined 3% compared to last year.\nAs Mike mentioned, we saw good demand over the Fourth of July and Labor Day holiday selling periods.\nFor the quarter, total retail comparable sales declined 3.5%, reflecting strong eCommerce growth of 17% and lower store sales.\nSeptember, which is the largest month of the year in our business, had particularly strong performance, with comparable store sales down only slightly versus last year.\nStore traffic continued to be a challenge for us and the broader industry.\nConsumers are understandably cautious, especially as we see virus counts rising again in many areas of the country.\nOur store traffic in the third quarter exceeded the industry benchmark, which we follow.\nWhile traffic was down, we saw improved conversion and higher transaction values in our stores in the third quarter.\nThe adjusted operating margin of our retail segment improved by 50 basis points to 11.4%, driven by improved price realization, especially online, and our improved inventory position and good control of spending.\nPlease refer to Page 9.\nClients continued to utilize our multi-channel options during Q3.\nWe've enhanced our stores to allow customers to quickly collect their online purchases.\nNumerous customers are also utilizing our new curbside pickup service.\nIn general, the coordination between our online business and our extensive network of convenient stores continues to improve.\nOn Page 10, our recent marketing campaigns remain closely integrated with our social media presence.\nDuring Q3, we surpassed our main competitors in children's clothing by gaining more Instagram and Facebook followers combined.\nOn Page 11, we saw exceptionally high engagement with two specific promotional events in September.\nDue to the pandemic, many families were unable to take their usual Labor Day vacation.\nRecognizing this, we organized a promotion offering staycation packages to families.\nThis campaign generated the highest social engagement ever for the Carter's brand.\nWe also celebrated the 125th anniversary of the OshKosh B'gosh brand, which included releasing Special Limited-edition vintage overalls for the whole family.\nThis promotion was highly successful, with the children's sizes of these special overalls selling out within a few weeks.\nPlease turn to Page 12.\nAnother family tradition that has gone digital is the announcement of an expected baby.\nDuring our Baby Love event in September, we distributed 10,000 Carter's bodysuits with the message \"2021, Looking Bright\" to celebrate the joyous news of babies due in 2021.\nMoving to Page 13.\nSince the pandemic started, we've been providing families with activity ideas for their increased time at home.\nWe recently launched a twice-weekly email series for parents of toddlers and babies, offering new ideas and tips for fall.\nThese communications have strengthened our relationships with our customers and reinforced that Carter's understands parenthood better than any other brand.\nOn the following page, it appears that social distancing will remain a reality for some time.\nLike many other traditions, children visiting Santa will be different this year, so we've partnered with the innovative Cameo platform to deliver personalized virtual messages from Santa to thousands of children for Christmas.\nThe next several pages showcase examples of our holiday marketing.\nThis year, families may be particularly looking forward to being together and celebrating the holidays.\nOn Page 15, we've observed strong demand for our holiday products.\nOn Page 16, Carter's is renowned for our pajamas, especially Christmas PJs, available in sizes for the entire family.\nOn Page 17, we also offer a wide range of special outfits for formal holiday occasions.\nThis year, on Page 18, we have toys from Skip Hop and Carter's.\nIn most of our stores, we will introduce special Santa's toy shops for the holiday season.\nMoving to Page 19, we'll review U.S. wholesale results for Q3.\nAlthough net sales were lower than last year, they significantly exceeded our expectations.\nThe improvement over our forecast was due to several factors.\nWe observed earlier demand for fall products from several retailers, strong replenishment demand for Little Baby Basics, and the impact of delayed product arrivals mentioned in our previous call was less severe than anticipated.\nAll our wholesale customers are expanding their online businesses, resulting in strong demand for our brands.\nDemand for our exclusive brands at Target, Walmart, and Amazon was robust in Q3, with combined sales growing 10% compared to last year.\nOur Skip Hop brand experienced good growth in the wholesale channel this quarter.\nWith consumers spending more time at home, Skip Hop's Home Gear, Playtime, and Bath Time products have become very popular.\nAs Mike mentioned, sales of the Carter's brand decreased in the quarter, partly because we proactively canceled a significant amount of fall and winter inventory commitments early in the pandemic, and many customers have understandably chosen to maintain leaner inventories in the current environment.\nShipments to the off-price channel decreased significantly in Q3, as we're more effectively using our own retail channels to clear excess inventory.\nU.S. Wholesale adjusted segment income was $67 million in Q3 compared to $73 million a year ago.\nAdjusted segment margin improved by 140 basis points to 22.3%, reflecting lower inventory-related charges partially offset by higher bad debt expense.\nOn Page 20, we launch our core Little Baby Basics collection annually.\nThis year, we did so in late June, which is somewhat later than usual.\nThese products are the essential items that every parent of a newborn needs.\nWe're seeing very strong performance of Little Baby Basics this year.\nWe sell these signature products through multiple channels, including some of our largest wholesale accounts like Kohl's and Macy's.\nPerformance in our own stores, on carters.com, and in our International business has also been strong.\nStarting on Page 21, we've included several slides highlighting our exclusive brands available at Target, Walmart, and Amazon.\nThe Just One You brand continues to perform well.\nTarget has invested in several digital campaigns promoting Just One You.\nThese campaigns have increased brand awareness among new and existing Target customers.\nSleepwear for infants and toddlers has been particularly successful, with plans for continued momentum in Q4 with Christmas pajamas and a wide assortment of sibling dressing products.\nOn Page 22, regarding the Child of Mine brand at Walmart.\nIn Q3, eCommerce sales of Child of Mine more than doubled compared to last year.\nHere too, investments in brand marketing have driven good productivity and momentum for Child of Mine, which we expect to continue into the holiday selling period.\nLastly, on Page 23, our Simple Joys brand continues to resonate with consumers.\nWe have a strong partnership with Amazon for Simple Joys, which has grown to be one of our largest brands.\nWe participated in another successful Prime Day recently, where we achieved a significant increase in sales.\nThe Simple Joys assortment has expanded over the past few years and now includes Baby, Toddler, and Pajamas up to size-eight, as well as shoes and accessories.\nMoving to Page 24 and Q3 results for our International segment.\nInternational net sales declined 10% to $114 million.\nThis decrease was primarily due to lower wholesale shipments to markets outside North America, partly due to the stronger U.S. dollar and disruptions caused by the global pandemic.\nCanada had a very good quarter overall, with retail comparable sales growing 7%.\nOnline demand remained strong with eCommerce comps up 58%.\nStore comps in Canada were slightly down, but the arrival of colder weather and strong back-to-school demand helped boost sales.\nNet sales in our Mexico business decreased year-over-year, reflecting a weaker peso and lower wholesale sales.\nWe're making good progress in the retail portion of the business in Mexico.\nOur new larger co-branded stores are performing well, and eCommerce, which we launched late last year, continues to show strong growth.\nInternational adjusted operating margin expanded 270 basis points to 15.8%,

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:I'll start by offering some insights on our company's performance and operations.\nWe anticipated an improvement in sales for the third quarter, as stated in our previous earnings call.\nRevenue for the quarter reached $113.8 million, representing a 2% decrease from the third quarter of 2019 but a 35% increase from the previous quarter.\nThe gross margin for the third quarter stood at 32.4%, showing a slight increase of 40 basis points compared to the same period in 2019 and an 80 basis point improvement from the second quarter of this year.\nAdjusted earnings per share for the third quarter were $0.34, marking a 17% increase from $0.29 in the same quarter last year and a rise from $0.18 in the second quarter of 2020.\nWe achieved an adjusted EBITDA margin of 19%, which is 230 basis points higher than the 16.7% recorded in the second quarter of 2020.\nThe third quarter saw new business contracts worth $127 million and the addition of seven new clients.\nAt the end of the quarter, our cash reserves stood at $132 million, with a debt of $106 million.\nFrom an operational standpoint, all of our facilities are currently functioning.\nWe're still facing some difficulties at our Mexican locations.\nThese facilities have improved their capacity from about 60% to around 90% since the last quarter.\nWe're keeping a close eye on local COVID-19 restriction changes at one of those facilities and at our Ostrava plant in the Czech Republic.\nAshish Agrawal is joining me for today's call and will guide us through the safe harbor statement.\nIf today's discussion mentions any non-GAAP measures under Regulation G, the necessary explanations and reconciliations can be found in the Investors section of the CTS website.\nI'll now hand the conversation back to our CEO, Kieran O'Sullivan.\nAs we deal with the COVID-19 situation, our staff are providing support and assistance to those in need within our local communities, which is a source of great pride for us.\nOur employees continue to show adaptability and quick response throughout our operations to meet all customer needs.\nOur top priority remains ensuring the safety of our employees and adhering to state and local regulations.\nWe are modifying our business and processes to concentrate on our key objectives: driving profitable growth, enhancing our market approach, improving our operational capabilities, and developing our leadership talent and culture.\nThe restructuring plan we announced in the previous earnings call is proceeding as expected and is projected to yield an annual earnings per share improvement of $0.22 to $0.26 by the latter half of 2022.\nMore crucially, we are concentrating on returning to growth, aiming for 10% in line with our strategic plan - 5% organic growth and 5% through strategic acquisitions.\nWe maintain our focus on strategic growth investments as part of our 2025 planning.\nOur main priority is expanding our business and broadening our range of products that sense, connect, and move.\nNew business contracts totaled $127 million for the quarter, marking the best quarterly performance this year.\nWe welcomed seven new customers in the quarter: four in the industrial sector, and one each in defense, medical, and telecom.\nIn the transportation sector, we secured a major passive safety sensor contract for an electric vehicle application in the Chinese market.\nWe also won multiple accelerated OEM contracts with customers in Asia and Europe, as well as a global platform deal with a North American OEM.\nThese recent wins leverage our inductive technology, which is crucial for growth in meeting mid- and high-end product requirements.\nWe obtained an additional ride height sensing contract with the same customer.\nCumulative electric and hybrid vehicle wins this year amount to approximately $75 million, and we anticipate further gains.\nIn the previous quarter, we reported our first win in current sensing, and we aim to expand this application to other regions.\nIn the defense sector, we were awarded contracts with several Tier one customers for sonar applications.\nMore recently, we developed and secured a new sample order for an ordinance application.\nIn Europe, we're working to increase our market share by building relationships with new customers.\nWe're leveraging our presence and capabilities in Denmark and the Czech Republic, where we recently received sample orders from two new Tier one defense customers.\nWe obtained a small initial order for temperature sensing technology in electric vehicle applications.\nThe battery management system's charging circuit incorporates the sensor.\nWe won a design contract for a 5G small cell application in multiple countries' systems within the precision frequency product line, and also received the distribution order.\nA multiyear design contract was awarded to us for a low-power crystal product in a defense application.\nWe persistently advance our product innovations.\nOur strategy in the transportation sector is to create sensor solutions that are compatible with various propulsion technologies, enhancing our growth potential as hybrid and electric vehicles become more prevalent in the coming decade.\nBy 2025, electric vehicles are anticipated to be more affordable than internal combustion engines due to decreasing battery costs.\nFifteen countries and two U.S. states have announced plans to phase out internal combustion engines between 2030 and 2040, with Norway aiming for 2025.\nWe anticipate electric vehicle market penetration to reach 9% by 2025 and 22% by 2030.\nOur innovative efforts focus on electronic braking, new accelerator interfaces, and high-performance temperature applications.\nWe continue to explore new material formulations as we target growth in defense, industrial, and medical markets.\nOur primary focus in the defense sector is on the solar market for forward and towed arrays.\nIn the industrial sector, we target in-jet printing, flow and position, as well as nondestructive testing.\nOur main focus in the medical sector is on medical ultrasound, intravascular medical ultrasound, ultrasonic therapy, and scalpel applications.\nWe continue to improve our traditional position sensing for industrial applications and develop new encoder products for medical equipment.\nWe are progressing with developments for ultra-low life high frequency TCXOs and OCXOs for millimeter wave and sub-6 gigahertz systems, continuing to gain design awards through a major telecom OEM.\nAlthough COVID-19 and associated travel restrictions have made the M&A environment more challenging, we are adapting and continuing to strengthen our pipeline of opportunities.\nWe aim to broaden our range of technologies, products, customers, and geographic reach.\nWe are making progress on our foundry operations and expect to complete the improvements this year.\nThe team is steadily improving process controls and subsequent efficiencies.\nThe Focus 2025 initiative emphasizes building stronger customer relationships.\nAs part of this initiative, we are enhancing our go-to-market capabilities, skills, and sales incentive plans to place greater emphasis on profitable growth.\nWe are striving to improve the quality of our sales funnel, optimize our end market approach, target new accounts, and align our functional areas to be more responsive and solution-oriented in line with our core values.\nAs part of our realignment on profitable growth, we are assessing the product portfolio for long-term growth and margin expansion.\nWe have transitioned from a period of sharp decline in the second quarter to a time of uncertainty as inventory levels are rebalanced and the market responds to high unemployment and other economic challenges.\nIn the U.S., the seasonally adjusted growth rate for 2020 is approximately 13 million units, a 21% decrease from last year.\nWe anticipate next year to be in the 14 million unit range.\nOn-hand days of supply are currently at 55 days, down from 65 days of supply in the third quarter of 2019.\nEuropean sales are projected to decrease by 24% from last year, and we expect 18.7 million unit levels in 2021.\nThe China market continues to show more resilience, with volumes predicted to decrease by 9%, ranging from 21 million to 22 million units this year and up to 24 million units next year.\nThere are indications that the commercial vehicle market may be improving as freight fundamentals continue to strengthen.\nIt's too early to determine the sustainability of this improvement.\nWe continue to observe stronger growth in industrial and defense markets.\nWe remain cautious about market conditions in the upcoming quarters.\nWe plan to resume providing annual guidance for fiscal year 2021 in February.\nOur financial liquidity remains strong.\nWe perceive this difficult period as a chance to enhance our abilities.\nAshish will now provide a more detailed explanation of our financial results.\nRevenue for the third quarter was $113.8 million, a 2% decrease from the previous year.\nSales bounced back significantly from the second quarter, increasing by 35%.\nYear-over-year sales to transportation clients declined by 9%.\nNevertheless, we experienced a 71% sequential growth.\nCompared to Q3 2019, sales to other markets grew by 10%, and sequentially by 5%.\nOur temperature sensing acquisition performed well, contributing $6.6 million.\nNon-transportation customer organic sales increased by 4% compared to last year.\nWe saw substantial growth in both defense and industrial sector sales.\nAs anticipated, the medical sector experienced a downturn.\nOur third quarter gross margin was 32.4%, an improvement of 80 basis points from last quarter and 40 basis points from last year.\nThe impact of COVID continues to create uncertainty.\nWe are maintaining our focus on cost efficiency and the ability to adjust production levels as needed.\nImproved revenue and careful cost management resulted in adjusted operating earnings of 13%, up 170 basis points from last year and 450 basis points sequentially.\nAs Kieran mentioned, we are making headway on the restructuring plan we initiated recently.\nWe will provide updates on improvements as we complete various aspects of the plan in upcoming quarters.\nOur year-to-date tax rate was about 24%, and we anticipate the full-year rate to be between 23% and 25%, excluding one-time items.\nEarnings for the third quarter of 2020 were $0.34 per diluted share.\nAdjusted earnings per diluted share were also $0.34, compared to $0.16 last quarter and $0.29 in the third quarter of 2019.\nTurning our attention to the balance sheet.\nOur controllable working capital as a percentage of sales was 15.6% at the end of the third quarter.\nThis is a significant improvement from 21.2% last quarter, though we acknowledge there is still much to be done to further enhance our working capital performance.\nWe generated $25.6 million in operating cash flow during the third quarter.\nYear-to-date, we have generated $49 million in operating cash flow, a 21% increase compared to 2019.\nThe strong cash performance in the third quarter allowed us to reduce our debt by $35 million.\nCapital expenditures totaled $3.2 million.\nWe expect capital expenditures for the full year to be less than 4% of sales.\nRegarding liquidity, our net cash position was $25 million, an improvement of about $20 million from the second quarter.\nWe have access to an additional $192 million through our revolving credit facility.\nAt present, we expect to remain comfortably within our debt covenants.\nWe are continuing to implement SAP.\nAs previously communicated, over 80% of our revenues come from sites using SAP.\nWe anticipate completing the implementation around mid-2021.\nHowever, COVID-related travel restrictions may cause some delays.\nThis concludes our prepared remarks.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Susie Lisa, the senior vice president of investor relations at CVS Health, is speaking.\nThis presentation is being streamed on our website and will remain available for a year.\nCVS Health has achieved another impressive quarter, surpassing expectations.\nWe are increasing our adjusted earnings per share guidance for the third consecutive quarter.\nThroughout 2021, we have advanced our strategy of providing an integrated healthcare experience focused on the consumer.\nWe maintained robust revenue growth across our primary business segments, improved health outcomes, and reduced expenses by expanding access to quality care.\nWe assisted in combating the pandemic and reached millions of consumers with convenient, accessible care across American communities.\nIn the third quarter, we achieved a 10% increase in revenue.\nThis significant growth was driven by increased membership in healthcare benefits and pharmacy services, as well as higher retail volume.\nWe increased adjusted operating income by 12.5%.\nWe produced adjusted earnings per share of $1.97 and generated strong operational cash flow of $5.5 billion.\nBased on these results and our outlook, we are elevating our adjusted earnings per share guidance to between $7.90 and $8.\nThis improved guidance reflects the quarter's exceptional performance and ongoing positive momentum, which Shawn will elaborate on soon.\nThe third quarter results once again show that our customers appreciate how we combine our unique set of assets, extensive healthcare knowledge, and numerous consumer touchpoints to address health needs.\nThere is high demand for our integrated solutions across the healthcare spectrum, including chronic condition management programs, mental health support, pharmacy services, and health and wellness products.\nWe gained over 1.3 million new integrated pharmacy and medical members during the 2021 and 2022 selling seasons.\nMore customers are seeking interconnected health services, such as virtual care.\nCVS Health introduced the first nationwide Virtual Primary Care program earlier this year.\nThis industry-leading solution provides access to a national network of physicians virtually and convenient in-person care at our MinuteClinic locations when necessary, often with no co-pay.\nOur program has expanded to 30 customer accounts with more than 750,000 eligible members as of January 1, 2022.\nThis demonstrates our ability to scale nationally and introduce innovative products to the market.\nOur customers recognize the value of CVS Health Care Solutions and the easy access we now provide in communities, homes, and virtually.\nOur high customer retention rates and new business acquisitions demonstrate the strength of our business model.\nHealthcare benefits revenue grew by 9.5% compared to the previous year.\nStrong performance in government services contributed to a 2.4% increase in adjusted operating income compared to the previous year, despite higher COVID-19 related costs, net of deferred care, primarily within our commercial segment.\nWe achieved sequential membership growth across all three product lines in the quarter: commercial, Medicare, and Medicaid.\nOur medical benefit ratio of 85.8% exceeded our expectations, driven by COVID-related costs, mainly in the commercial sector.\nNon-COVID costs developed in line with our projections.\nWe anticipate that total medical costs will slightly surpass baseline levels for the full year.\nWe delivered strong results in our Medicare business and increased membership both sequentially and year-over-year across all Medicare products.\nThis reflects our robust product portfolio, Stars performance, and reputation for excellent service.\nYear-to-date, Medicare Advantage membership has grown by 9.2%.\nIn 2022, we expect to achieve double-digit growth in individual Medicare and generate strong momentum in dual eligibles.\nOur strong performance in Stars continues, as evidenced by our 2022 results, with 87% of our members in Star plans rated four and higher, up from 83% in 2021.\nIn our commercial business, we anticipate moderate growth in 2022 for national accounts, driven by both increased sales, which are up approximately 50% year-over-year, and a 95% client retention rate.\nAs we mentioned earlier this year, we are re-entering the individual exchanges in eight states starting January 2022.\nEnrollment began on Monday, and we expect our co-branded CVS Aetna offering and benefit design focused on consumer choice will result in gains of at least 100,000 new members in 2022.\nRegarding pharmacy services, we achieved third quarter revenue growth of 9.3% and adjusted operating income growth of 9.5% compared to the previous year.\nFor the 2022 selling season, we achieved a 98% retention rate.\nWe generated $10.4 billion of new business growth, resulting in $8.9 billion of net new business wins, demonstrating our market-leading trend management, transparency, customer service, and integrated offerings.\nWe continue to lead in specialty pharmacy with programs that create value in the market, provide significant savings to customers, and set us apart as we enhance our programs with digital assets.\nWe maintained strong momentum this quarter with specialty revenue up 8.7% compared to the previous year.\nOur service excellence and top-tier execution are key differentiating factors.\nOur retail segment continues to play a crucial role as a local health destination for millions of Americans.\nRetail outperformed both expectations and the industry in the third quarter.\nWe achieved 10% revenue growth and 22% adjusted operating income growth compared to the previous year.\nPharmacy sales and prescriptions filled both increased by 8% year-over-year, largely driven by COVID-19 vaccine administration and core pharmacy services.\nOur patient satisfaction scores remain high, with approximately 90% of customers satisfied with their experience at CVS Health locations.\nWe continue to support millions of Americans with COVID-19 testing and vaccine administration.\nWe administered 11.6 million COVID-19 vaccines and 8.5 million COVID-19 tests in the quarter.\nSince our program began, we have administered 43 million vaccines and approximately 38 million tests.\nWe also expanded our digital capabilities to provide universal access to CVS Health vaccination records for the millions of adults we have vaccinated.\nThis new feature has driven over 1 million visits per month to vaccination records on cvs.com.\nThis provides another opportunity for us to build deeper engagement with our customers while simplifying and connecting their health experience.\nFront store sales momentum also continued with revenue growth of 13% compared to the previous year.\nFront store sales were driven by consumer demand for COVID-19 home testing kits, as well as cough and cold products, with year-over-year volume increases across most front store categories.\nOur CVS Health retail presence consistently serves as a strong channel for acquiring new customers.\nIn fact, this year, 12.5% of new COVID-19 testing customers chose to fill new prescriptions or receive a COVID-19 vaccination with CVS Health.\nLastly, we anticipate that the benefit from administering boosters and pediatric doses to eligible consumers will primarily occur in the fourth quarter of this year.\nWe continue to make significant progress with our strategy to deliver a superior customer experience and address the total cost of care.\nWe have focused on several key areas.\nFirst, with our unique portfolio of businesses, we continue to expand our role in care delivery designed around the customer.\nWe're taking a proactive stance to address the evolving requirements of our customers, clients, and communities.\nWe're enhancing accessibility, reducing expenses, and integrating local care points to streamline the consumer health experience.\nOur extensive network of physician assistants, combined with our nationwide presence, allows us to provide localized care on a national scale.\nWe plan to increase customer engagement by transforming select CVS locations into community health hubs, offering three distinct models: primary care centers, enhanced health and wellness stores, and traditional CVS Pharmacy outlets.\nOur standard CVS Pharmacy stores will continue to offer prescription services along with health, wellness, and convenient retail products.\nOur diverse business portfolio and widespread community presence enable us to meet consumers where they are, enhancing their well-being and playing a larger role in their wellness journey.\nWe're enhancing the consumer experience by expanding digital services and platforms that connect to health services and physical locations for our over 35 million unique digital customers.\nCurrently, more than 70% of CVS Pharmacy customers are signed up for our text messaging services.\nAmong this group, our adherence outreach efforts led to a 10% increase in filled prescriptions this quarter.\nImproved adherence results in better health outcomes and lower overall costs.\nIn today's digitally connected, consumer-driven world, the demand for omnichannel pharmacy services is at an all-time high.\nWe're continuously modernizing our operating systems and improving our pharmacy model integration to simplify customer interactions and boost engagement.\nWe're investing in our employees as a key part of our workforce strategy.\nWe recently announced a gradual increase in the minimum wage to $15 per hour by July 2022.\nWe've invested in updating our training programs and technology for our frontline and clinical staff.\nDespite a competitive job market and anticipated increased demand for health services, we've bolstered our workforce across all business areas.\nWe hired a record number of employees in the third quarter to support open enrollment and customer service, as well as enhance our technological and clinical capabilities.\nNearly 20,000 pharmacists, pharmacy technicians, and nurses recently joined CVS Health to support flu season and COVID-19 vaccinations and testing.\nOur pharmacists and pharmacy technicians play a crucial role in our overall workforce strategy.\nWe're committed to supporting our pharmacists, including providing immunization bonuses in the latter half of this year.\nWe look forward to sharing more about our strategy to improve access, quality, and customer engagement at our investor day on December 9.\nWe remain steadfast in our commitment to shareholders, customers, and communities.\nHealth equity is crucial as the pandemic continues to disproportionately affect certain communities.\nIn addition to targeted vaccine and booster education efforts, we've provided 31 million meals to those experiencing food insecurity and invested in 2,800 affordable housing units across 30 cities this year.\nAddressing social determinants of health through permanent housing can reduce healthcare costs by 59%.\nWe've hired Dr. Joneigh Khaldun to build on our efforts to promote health equity and better support underserved communities, and our increased wages and bonuses support our employees, their families, and their communities.\nFor the third consecutive quarter, we've exceeded our plan and raised our adjusted earnings per share guidance.\nWe continue to enhance our diverse portfolio of assets to serve our customers.\nWe anticipate a strong year-end, made possible by the leadership and commitment of our over 300,000 CVS Health colleagues who bring their heart to every moment of our customers' health journey.\nOur third quarter results show a continuation of the strong performance seen in the first half of 2021, exceeding our expectations in revenue, cash flow, and adjusted earnings per share.\nThese results stem from our unique portfolio of capabilities and strong focus on operational execution.\nThis performance momentum allows us to once again raise our outlook for 2021.\nLooking at the enterprise as a whole, total revenues of $73.8 billion increased 10% year over year with robust growth across all three segments.\nWe reported adjusted operating income of $4.1 billion, a 12.5% increase compared to the previous year.\nThis growth in adjusted operating income was also reflected in strong cash flow generation in the third quarter, with year-to-date cash flow from operations now exceeding $14 billion.\nAdjusted earnings per share of $1.97 represent a nearly 19% year-over-year increase, driven by our adjusted operating income growth and lower interest expense resulting from our ongoing debt reduction efforts.\nExamining the segments, Healthcare Benefits revenue increased by 9.5% year over year, driven by sustained growth in our Government Services business, slightly offset by the repeal of the health insurance fee.\nIn the third quarter, we saw Medicaid membership grow sequentially by 67,000 members across multiple regions.\nMedicare Advantage membership also continued to grow, increasing by 42,000 members sequentially and representing year-over-year growth of 9.8%.\nOur Medicare Advantage franchise continues to be a powerful growth engine, with membership more than doubling since the third quarter of 2015, representing a 15% compound annual growth rate.\nOur focus has now shifted to ensuring a successful 2022 annual enrollment period for Medicare, which began on October 1.\nWhile still early in the process, we are pleased with the results we've seen so far.\nHealthcare Benefits adjusted operating income grew modestly year over year but fell below our expectations for the quarter due to higher-than-expected COVID-related medical costs in our commercial business.\nWith the surge in nationwide COVID cases stemming from the Delta variant, we experienced higher-than-anticipated COVID-related medical costs in August and September.\nThree key factors contributed to this difference from our expectations.\nFirst, commercial COVID inpatient admissions in August and September were comparable to the peak levels experienced in January 2021 and were nearly three times the average of the second quarter of 2021.\nSecond, COVID testing costs, which we had expected to moderate during the third quarter, also approached January 2021 levels and were more than 1.5 times the average we experienced in the second quarter.\nIt's important to recognize the significant impact of COVID testing on overall claim costs, as testing expenses represented approximately 35% of gross COVID costs in the quarter.\nLastly, while non-COVID deferred care was better than we had forecast, it was not enough to fully offset these higher COVID costs in commercial.\nThe resulting medical benefit ratio for the quarter of 85.8% was above our forecast and driven almost entirely by the higher-than-expected commercial COVID testing and treatment costs.\nTwo important aspects of HCB's third quarter performance should be noted.\nFirst, aside from these COVID dynamics, underlying performance in our commercial book of business continues to align with our expectations.\nSecond, in our government services business, we also saw an increase in COVID treatment and testing costs, but it was far less pronounced than in commercial.\nThis lower level of increase was fully offset by better-than-expected deferred care.\nAs a result, the overall performance of our Government Services business met expectations.\nTo conclude the HCB segment overview, we experienced favorable prior period development in the quarter for both commercial and government products.\nDays claims payable of 51 at the end of the third quarter is three days higher sequentially and two days above the prior year.\nWhile influenced by many factors, with the anticipated decrease in COVID-related claims in the fourth quarter, we expect DCP to return to more typical levels in Q4.\nOverall, we remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves.\nShifting our focus to pharmacy-related services.\nOur capacity to achieve sustainable and profitable growth remains evident.\nWe anticipate that 2021 will mark the second consecutive year of over 10% growth in adjusted operating income.\nThis continued expansion is attributed to our consistent delivery of industry-leading drug trend for our clients, our proven top-tier capabilities, particularly in specialty pharmacy, and our exceptional customer service, as evidenced by our over 98% renewal rate for 2022.\nIn the third quarter, pharmacy revenues grew by 9.3% compared to the previous year, driven by increased pharmacy claim volumes, specialty pharmacy growth, and brand inflation.\nThe total number of pharmacy members increased by 1.6 million sequentially, primarily due to growth in government programs.\nThe total number of processed pharmacy claims grew by nearly 7% compared to the previous year.\nAlmost half of this growth was due to new business in 2021, with COVID vaccine administration and new therapy prescriptions also contributing to the year-over-year increase.\nIt's worth noting that new therapy prescriptions were negatively affected in the third quarter of 2020 due to the pandemic.\nPharmacy adjusted operating income surpassed expectations in the quarter, increasing by more than $150 million or 9.5% compared to the previous year.\nThe three main factors driving this increase remain consistent with the second quarter.\nThese factors include improved purchasing economics reflecting the products and services of our group purchasing organization launched in the second quarter of 2020, continued strength in our specialty pharmacy business driven by 340B administration, and increased pharmacy claims volumes, all of which were partially offset by ongoing but stable client pricing pressure.\nOur retail division delivered strong results this quarter, once again exceeding expectations.\nTotal revenue of just under $25 billion increased by $2.3 billion or 10% compared to the previous year.\nThis increase can be attributed to two main components.\nApproximately half, or $1.2 billion, is due to the administration of over 11 million COVID vaccines and more than 8 million COVID tests, combined with strong front store sales driven by demand for over-the-counter COVID test kits and related treatment categories.\nBased on this quarter's results, we are now on track to administer about 44 million to 49 million COVID vaccines and 28 million to 33 million COVID tests for the full year 2021.\nThe remaining half, or $1.1 billion, was driven by a combination of sustained pharmacy growth and broad strength in front store trends across various categories, partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure.\nThis strong revenue growth, combined with a 70-basis-point improvement in adjusted operating margin, resulted in adjusted operating income that exceeded our forecast and led to a year-over-year increase of $300 million.\nThis growth in adjusted operating income, driven by COVID testing, vaccines, and front store sales, was partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure, business investments including minimum wage increases and other performance incentives, and increased staffing to provide expanded levels of service.\nFocusing on cash flows and the balance sheet.\nOur liquidity and capital position remained excellent at the end of the third quarter, with cash from operations of $5.5 billion for the quarter and $14.3 billion year to date.\nThrough our proactive liability management transaction in August, we reduced our net long-term debt by $1.1 billion in the quarter.\nAs of the end of the third quarter 2021, we have repaid a net total of $18.7 billion in long-term debt since finalizing the Aetna transaction.\nAdditionally, we returned over $650 million to shareholders through our quarterly dividend.\nLet me now discuss our revised 2021 guidance.\nThis increase reflects strong performance in pharmacy services and retail, partially offset by expected COVID-related pressure in our healthcare benefits business, specifically in the commercial sector.\nWe are raising our total revenue outlook to between $286.5 billion and $290.3 billion, and our adjusted operating income outlook to between $16.4 billion and $16.6 billion.\nWe are also increasing our expected full year cash flow from operations to a range of $13 billion to $13.5 billion.\nNote that this increased cash flow forecast is actually lower than our September year-to-date figure, reflecting expected payments in the fourth quarter that were accrued in 2020, including FICA taxes and increased minimum loss ratio rebates, as well as the timing of receipts and payments between the third and fourth quarters.\nI'll now highlight some key points related to the segments and full year guidance.\nFor the healthcare benefits segment, we are lowering our full year adjusted operating income guidance from $5.25 billion - $5.35 billion to $4.9 billion - $5 billion.\nWe expect the full year medical benefit ratio to be in a range of 84.4% to 85.6%, an increase of 30 basis points from our previous range.\nThis reflects the higher-than-expected commercial COVID medical costs observed in the third quarter and our expectation that these will continue, although at a lower level, into the fourth quarter.\nEarly October operational data indicates that COVID inpatient admissions are tracking at approximately half the levels of September.\nIt's important to remember the significant impact of testing costs on expenses.\nWhile we expect Q4 testing expenses to be lower than Q3, we do not anticipate they will decline as much as inpatient expenses.\nLastly, recall the normal seasonality of the healthcare benefits segment, with fourth quarter operating income typically being the lowest of the year due to deductible satisfaction producing the highest quarterly medical costs.\nFor pharmacy services, given the continued strength in the quarter and our visibility for the remainder of the year, we are increasing full year 2021 adjusted operating income guidance to $6.85 billion - $6.94 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 20.5% to 22%.\nWe anticipate that the strength in third quarter pharmacy services results will largely continue into the fourth quarter.\nIn the retail/long-term care segment, we are also increasing our full year 2021 adjusted operating income guidance to $6.98 billion - $7.07 billion.\nAs you consider the fourth quarter, we currently expect vaccinations to continue, although at a lower rate than the third quarter.\nWe have also taken into account the impact of the CDC's COVID booster recommendations, as well as a modest impact from pediatric vaccinations.\nWe expect testing to decline modestly compared to the levels experienced during the third quarter.\nGiven retail's Q3 outperformance and Q4 outlook, we now expect the full year 2021 COVID impact to be neutral.\nThis compares to our previous guidance in August for an overall modest negative net impact.\nAs we concluded the third quarter, we are very pleased with the performance of our businesses, which provides us with a strong foundation as we look ahead to 2022.\nWhile we plan to share more details at our upcoming investor day in early December in New York, I want to update you on our thoughts regarding the 2022 outlook.\nAlthough many factors are still to be determined, we believe that current analyst estimates for 2022 adjusted earnings per share of approximately $8.20 are within our anticipated initial guidance range.\nAs discussed last quarter, there are significant factors to consider when determining an appropriate baseline for 2021.\nIn 2022, we will incur a full year of expenses related to our minimum wage increase announced last quarter.\nWe estimate these factors combined represent approximately $0.40 per share.\nUsing the midpoint of our updated 2021 adjusted earnings per share guidance range, which is $7.95, these adjustments create a 2021 baseline of $7.55.\nAnother significant factor in considering 2022 performance is the effect that COVID will have on our retail and healthcare benefits businesses.\nFor retail, we expect that COVID-19 vaccine and testing volume, which is expected to generate over $3 billion of revenue in 2021, will decline significantly in 2022 to 30% to 40% of the volume we administered in 2021.\nAdditionally, we expect COVID-driven front store sales to decline in 2022.\nFor HCB, we expect to see a significant improvement in results in 2022, as treatment and testing costs decline with COVID cost estimates and improved risk-adjusted revenue reflected in our pricing.\nOverall, we estimate the COVID-driven impact in HCB will largely be offset by the expected decline in COVID-related retail performance.\nIt's important to note that forecasts of future COVID impacts on our business remain extremely difficult and are subject to change as circumstances dictate.\nBeyond these considerations, other factors affecting our growth for 2022 remain consistent with the commentary we provided last quarter regarding headwinds and tailwinds.\nConsidering all of this, the current consensus of analyst estimates of approximately $8.20 for adjusted earnings per share would represent about an 8% increase over the 2021 baseline.\nTo summarize, CVS Health's strong performance in the first half of 2021 continued in the third quarter, producing strong revenue, adjusted operating income, and cash flow results, and we are pleased to again raise our full year 2021 adjusted earnings per share guidance.\nDuring the pandemic, we have solidified our opportunity to become a national leader in healthcare delivery, which fundamentally involves lowering the cost of care, improving access and convenience, ultimately enabling people to live healthier and more fulfilling lives.\nAt our investor day in a few weeks, we look forward to sharing more about our strategy for the coming years to deliver on this ambition and to position CVS Health to generate sustainable, low double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth.\nSummary: ",

I'm extremely proud of their dedication.\nThroughout the pandemic, we've prioritized employee and customer safety while meeting community needs as an essential business.\nWe took measures like providing protective equipment, offering dedicated shopping hours for vulnerable groups, and supporting employee vaccination.\nWe invested about $248 million in pandemic response in 2020, including around $167 million in bonuses for frontline staff to recognize their exceptional work during a difficult year.\nDollar General aims to support customers through our extensive network of over 17,000 stores located near most of the U.S. population.\nWe're focused on advancing our key strategies and initiatives to meet evolving customer needs and drive sustainable long-term growth.\nWe're excited to provide an update on some of our plans for 2021.\nWe'll continue expanding several key initiatives like our non-consumables initiative, Fast Track, and completing the initial DG Fresh rollout.\nOur new pOpshelf stores have exceeded expectations for sales and margins. We plan to accelerate pOpshelf openings in 2021 and incorporate the concept into some larger Dollar General locations.\nWe're introducing changes to our store development strategy, including expanding our Dollar General Plus format and testing two new larger store formats.\nMost new stores will use our new larger base prototype, replacing traditional formats and allowing for optimized product assortment and future growth.\nWe've identified more potential locations for small-box stores in the continental U.S. than previously estimated.\nThe fourth quarter saw strong top and bottom line growth.\nNon-consumable categories again outperformed consumables, marking the 11th straight quarter of growth.\nMonthly comps increased high single digits in December and mid-teens in November and January.\nQ4 net sales rose 17.6% to $8.4 billion, driven by 12.7% comp sales growth.\nWe gained market share in consumables, with increases in both units and dollars sold.\nWe attracted more new customers, who tend to be younger, higher-income and more diverse.\nOperating margin expanded significantly, contributing to Q4 earnings per share of $2.62, up 24.8%.\nFull year net sales increased 21.6% to $33.7 billion, with 16.3% comp sales growth.\nWe opened our 17,000th store and launched the pOpshelf concept in 2020.\nWe completed a record 2,780 real estate projects, exceeding our initial target.\nWe made strategic investments to strengthen our competitive position in the discount retail sector.\nOur results reflect strong execution and validate our growth strategies.\nWe're laying groundwork for future initiatives to drive additional growth.\nWe believe our unique store network provides competitive advantages in the current retail environment.\nI'm proud of our team's achievements and excited about future opportunities.\nGross profit margin increased 77 basis points to 32.5%, our seventh straight quarter of expansion.\nThis was driven by reduced markdowns, higher initial markups, more non-consumable sales, and lower shrink.\nThese were partially offset by increased transportation and distribution costs.\nSG&A as a percentage of sales increased 48 basis points to 22.2%, mainly due to COVID-19 related expenses.\nQ4 operating profit rose 21% to $872 million, or 10.4% of sales.\nCOVID-19 positively impacted operating profit through higher sales, partially offset by $96 million in pandemic-related investments.\nThe Q4 effective tax rate was 22.7%, compared to 23% last year.\nQ4 earnings per share increased 24.8% to $2.62, contributing to full year EPS of $10.62, up 59.9%.\nOur strong balance sheet and cash flow provide flexibility to support stakeholders, invest for growth, and return value to shareholders.\nAt year-end, merchandise inventories reached $5.2 billion, showing an overall increase of 12.2% and a 6.3% rise per store.\nWe are making good progress in improving our in-stock position and are satisfied with our overall inventory levels, although some high-demand products still have higher stock than desired.\nOperating cash flow in 2020 was substantial, totaling $3.9 billion, which represents a $1.6 billion or 73.2% increase.\nThe year's total capital expenditures were $1 billion, encompassing planned investments in new stores, remodels, relocations, distribution and transportation projects, and spending on strategic initiatives.\nDuring the quarter, we bought back 4.3 million shares of our common stock for $900 million and distributed a quarterly dividend of $0.36 per outstanding common share, totaling $87 million.\nWith the recent announcement of additional share repurchase authorization, we now have approximately $2.4 billion remaining under the repurchase program.\nOur capital allocation priorities continue to be effective and remain consistent.\nOur top priority is investing in high-return growth opportunities, including expanding our store network and advancing our strategic initiatives.\nWe remain dedicated to returning significant cash to shareholders through planned share repurchases and quarterly dividends, while maintaining our current investment-grade credit rating and managing a leverage ratio of about 3 times adjusted debt to EBITDA.\nWe now turn to our financial outlook for 2021.\nWe continue to operate in uncertain times regarding the COVID-19 pandemic's severity and duration, including its impact on the economy, consumer behavior, and our business.\nDespite ongoing uncertainty, we are providing select annual guidance to offer the best perspective we can, based on current information.\nHowever, several potential factors not incorporated into our guidance could affect our business this year, as their timing, extent, and potential impacts are unclear. These include, but are not limited to: the recently approved government stimulus package, other unknown external factors related to the ongoing health crisis and its impact on consumer behavior, and potential changes to minimum wage rates.\nWith this in mind, our expectations for 2021 include: net sales ranging from a 2% decline to flat; same-store sales declining 4% to 6%, reflecting 10% to 12% growth on a two-year stack basis; and earnings per share between $8.80 and $9.50, representing a compound annual growth rate of 15% to 20% (or 14% to 19% on an adjusted basis) over two years, surpassing our long-term goal of at least 10% annual adjusted earnings per share growth.\nOur earnings per share guidance assumes an effective tax rate between 22% and 23%.\nWe expect capital spending to range from $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion as we continue investing in our strategic initiatives and core business to support and drive future growth.\nWe plan to repurchase approximately $1.8 billion of our common stock this year, reflecting our strong liquidity position and confidence in our business's long-term growth potential.\nLet me provide additional context for our expectations.\nGiven the unusual circumstances, I'll elaborate on our Q1 comp sales trends.\nDespite losing about 8,400 store operating days due to winter weather closures across the country, February same-store sales increased 5.7%, reflecting a healthy 11.2% increase on a two-year stack basis.\nFrom late February through March 16, comp sales decreased approximately 16% as we face our most challenging monthly comp sales comparison of the year. For reference, March 2020 comp sales growth was 34.5%.\nLooking ahead, we remain cautious about our 2021 sales outlook due to continued significant uncertainty and unique comparisons to last year.\nWe expect stronger performance in the second half of 2021, given more difficult sales comparisons in the first half, particularly in Q1.\nRegarding gross margin, 2020 benefited from a higher proportion of sales from our higher-margin non-consumable categories, with full-year net sales percentage increases in these categories significantly exceeding our consumables business.\nWe anticipate our sales mix will shift towards consumables categories in 2021, pressuring our rate. However, the timing and impact of this shift are currently uncertain.\nGross margins in 2020 also benefited from reduced markdowns, including higher sell-through rates in seasonal and clearance-sensitive non-consumable categories due to significant customer demand.\nWe expect markdown rates to increase somewhat from the abnormally low levels of 2020, likely creating some gross margin pressure compared to last year.\nWhile we continue to see higher carrier rates and fuel costs, our ongoing efforts to improve efficiencies and reduce expenses, including further expansion of our private fleet, are expected to help partially offset these cost pressures in 2021.\nKeep in mind that the second and third quarters represent the most challenging comparisons for gross profit rate, following improvements of 167 basis points in Q2 2020 and 178 basis points in Q3 2020.\nRegarding SG&A, we expect ongoing pandemic-related expenses in 2021, but anticipate a significant reduction in COVID-19-related costs compared to last year.\nHowever, the leverage from these reduced costs is expected to be offset by deleverage from lower comp sales and approximately $60 million to $70 million in incremental year-over-year investments related to our strategic initiatives as we expand their rollouts.\nWe anticipate our strategic initiatives will positively contribute to operating profit and margin in 2021, driven by NCI and DG Fresh, as we expect the gross margin benefits will outweigh the associated expenses.\nWe estimate Q1 operating profit will be negatively impacted by approximately $35 million to $40 million due to lost sales from store closures and expenses related to February's widespread winter weather.\nIn conclusion, we are proud of our team's execution and performance, resulting in exceptional fourth quarter and full year results.\nWe continue to manage expenses and capital disciplined, aiming to deliver consistent, strong financial performance while strategically investing for the long term.\nWe remain confident in our business model and ongoing financial priorities to drive profitable same-store sales growth, healthy new store returns, strong free cash flow, and long-term shareholder value.\nLet me update you on our operating priorities, including strategic initiatives and plans for 2021.\nOur first operating priority is driving profitable sales growth. The team performed exceptionally well in 2020.\nNCI, which consists of new and expanded product offerings in key non-consumable categories, was available in over 5,800 stores by the end of 2020, including nearly 400 stores in our light version. This exceeded our prior expectation of more than 5,600 stores.\nGiven our strong performance, we plan to expand this offering to about 5,700 additional stores this year, bringing the total number of NCI stores to over 11,000 by year-end. This includes over 2,100 stores in our light version, which incorporates most of the NCI assortment through a more streamlined approach.\nOur newest concept, pOpshelf, builds on our success and learnings with NCI. pOpshelf aims to engage customers with a fun, affordable, and differentiated treasure hunt experience, offering continually refreshed merchandise, a unique in-store experience, and exceptional value with about 95% of items priced at $5 or less.\nWe opened our first five pOpshelf locations in 2020. Given strong results, we're accelerating the rollout in 2021, targeting up to 50 pOpshelf stores by year-end, up from our previous goal of about 30.\nAdditionally, we plan to incorporate this concept in up to 25 Dollar General stores in 2021 as a store-within-a-store format. These smaller footprint pOpshelf shops will be prominently positioned in the center of the store, with both Dollar General and pOpshelf branding on exterior entrances to build awareness.\nOur goal is to test, learn, and expand to more locations over time, leveraging the unique strengths of these complementary formats and building on pOpshelf's early success by making it available to a broader customer base.\nRegarding DG Fresh, our strategic shift to self-distribution of frozen and refrigerated goods, we continue to be pleased with the product cost savings. DG Fresh remains the largest contributor to the gross margin benefit from higher initial markups on inventory purchases, and we expect this benefit to grow as we scale this initiative.\nAnother important goal of DG Fresh is to increase sales in these categories. We're pleased with our success, driven by higher overall in-stock levels and the introduction of new products in select stores serviced by DG Fresh.\nGiven our success, we're accelerating the rollout of additional offerings, recently introducing more products, including national and private brands, to optimize our assortment and increase relevance with customers.\nWhile produce isn't included in our initial rollout plans, we believe DG Fresh provides a potential path to expanding our produce offering to more than 10,000 stores over time, capitalizing on our extensive self-distribution capabilities.\nBy the end of 2020, we were self-distributing to over 16,000 stores from 10 facilities.\nThis exceeded our earlier projection of more than 14,000 stores by year's end.\nWe are on schedule to finish our initial rollout across the chain in 2021.\nOur cooler expansion program continues to be our most significant merchandising initiative.\nWe installed over 62,000 cooler doors across our stores in 2020.\nWe plan to add more than 65,000 cooler doors in 2021, continuing our multi-year growth trend in cooler doors and related sales.\nIn 2019, we began using high-capacity coolers in most new, remodeled, and relocated stores, creating more opportunities to improve on-shelf availability and offer a wider product range, facilitated by DG Fresh.\nOur FedEx partnership now offers package pickup and dropoff services in over 8,500 stores, with plans to expand to over 9,500 stores by year-end, furthering our history of serving rural areas.\nWe are pursuing additional ways to improve gross margin, including boosting private brand sales, global sourcing, and enhancing supply chain efficiency, alongside the benefits from NCI and DG Fresh.\nOur 2021 supply chain plans include expanding our private fleet, which made up over 20% of our outbound fleet at the end of 2020.\nThe new Walton, Kentucky dry distribution center is expected to increase efficiency by reducing stem miles.\nWe plan to open two more DG Fresh facilities in 2021 to optimize our fresh network and support future growth.\nOur combination DG Fresh and dry distribution center in Blair, Nebraska is expected to be completed soon and will help further reduce stem miles over time.\nWhile we made good progress in 2020, reducing shrink remains a key opportunity area.\nWe continue to expand our use of electronic article surveillance by tagging more items and using technology to improve in-store execution.\nOur high-return, low-risk real estate model remains a core business strength.\nIn 2020, we completed 2,780 real estate projects, including 1,000 new stores, 1,670 remodels, and 110 relocations.\nWe now offer produce in more than 1,100 stores.\nFor 2021, we plan 2,900 real estate projects: 1,050 new stores, 1,750 remodels, and 100 relocations.\nWe aim to add produce to about 700 stores, bringing the total number of stores with produce to over 1,800.\nWe're evolving our store base by expanding our DGP format and introducing two new format types.\nOur first new format and DGP concept, with about 8,500 square feet of selling space, allows for more high-capacity coolers, an extended queue line, and a broader product range.\nWe expect over 550 of our real estate projects this year to use one of these format types to enhance our value and convenience proposition, especially in rural America.\nThe second new format has about 9,500 square feet of selling space, featuring an extended queue line, broader assortment, nearly 50 high-capacity coolers, expanded produce, fresh meat, and additional checkout lanes, including self-checkout.\nWe believe this larger format better meets our customers' growing needs, particularly in underserved markets, and we aim to have over 100 locations by year-end.\nThese larger formats incorporate our best initiatives and are designed to expand high-growth categories in a customer-friendly way while maintaining strong returns.\nWe now estimate there are approximately 13,000 additional small-box store opportunities in the Continental U.S. for Dollar General stores, up from our previous estimate of nearly 12,000.\nWe estimate pOpshelf could add about 3,000 additional store opportunities, with another 1,000 for our smaller DGX format.\nIn total, we estimate about 17,000 new store opportunities across our format types, indicating significant potential for new unit growth.\nOur digital initiative complements our physical stores by using technology to enhance the in-store customer experience.\nWe aim to create a digital ecosystem tailored to provide customers with a more convenient, frictionless, and personalized shopping experience.\nIn 2020, we rapidly rolled out DG Pickup to over 17,000 stores, offering a contactless shopping option.\nWe saw increased customer engagement across our digital platforms, including our digital coupons, shopping list feature, cart calculator, eCommerce site, DG Go! mobile checkout, and mobile app, which had nearly 4 million monthly active users by year-end.\nOur future plans include offering more relevant and personalized options to increase customer engagement and loyalty.\nWe maintain a disciplined approach to spending through our Save to Serve zero-based budgeting process, keeping the customer central to all decisions while reinforcing cost control.\nOur Fast Track initiative aims to increase store labor productivity, improve customer convenience, and enhance on-shelf availability.\nWe've seen labor productivity improvements from rolltainer and case pack optimization, leading to more efficient store stocking.\nSelf-checkout, part of Fast Track, offers customers a flexible checkout option while increasing store associate efficiency.\nSelf-checkout was available in over 1,600 stores at the end of 2020, with plans to introduce it in most stores by the end of 2022.\nWe aim to keep business simple, move quickly on growth opportunities, control expenses, and remain a low-cost operator.\nAs we grow, we continue to create new jobs and offer career advancement opportunities.\nOver 12,000 of our current store managers were promoted internally.\nWe offer development opportunities through our private fleet expansion, DG Fresh, and pOpshelf.\nIn 2020, we transitioned to virtual learning, providing nearly 3 million training hours for employees through our award-winning programs.\nThese efforts have resulted in record low store manager turnover, high staffing levels, strong applicant flows, and a robust internal promotion pipeline.\nWe believe offering career development opportunities with a growing, purpose-driven company helps us attract and retain talent.\nWe're making significant progress on our operating priorities and strategic initiatives.\nWe have a strong set of initiatives for 2021 and are confident in our plans for long-term sustainable growth and shareholder value creation.\nOur unique combination of value and convenience continues to resonate with customers, positioning us well for the future.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:The precise impact of COVID-19 on our operations remains unclear at this point.\nWe will be discussing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial metrics during this conference call.\nKevin will begin by providing an overview of the business, followed by Lewis who will present Dolby's financial results and projections for the third quarter and latter half of fiscal 2021.\nWe've had a promising start to our fiscal year with another robust performance in licensing revenue this quarter.\nOur revenue for the first half of fiscal 2021 has increased by approximately 10% compared to the same period in fiscal 2020, with an even higher growth rate in earnings.\nThe strength of Dolby's business model and the widespread adoption of our technologies across consumer devices and services are reflected in our financial performance.\nI'd like to highlight some areas of progress and recent examples of how Dolby is expanding its content offerings before Lewis delves into the financial details.\nAs more content experiences become Dolby experiences, we enhance our value proposition for deeper adoption in existing device categories and address use cases for adoption in new device categories, collectively driving our growth opportunities.\nDolby Atmos for music represents a significant advancement in how people can enjoy their favorite songs, creating new opportunities to expand Dolby Atmos adoption across a wider range of devices and services.\nLucid Motors has announced that they will be introducing the first car to market featuring Dolby Atmos.\nThe Lucid Air will offer the Dolby Atmos music experience in-car, marking the first example of addressing a key entertainment use case in the automotive sector.\nLucid is just one illustration of how we're creating more ways for consumers to enjoy an expanding library of Dolby Atmos music.\nWe're collaborating closely with top artists worldwide as more songs and albums become available in Dolby Atmos, including recent Grammy nominees like Taylor Swift, Lady Gaga, and Megan Thee Stallion.\nThis quarter, Hungama, a leading music streaming service in India, began offering Dolby Atmos support.\nThey join TIDAL, Amazon Music, and Anghami in streaming music in Dolby Atmos.\nAs we continue to build momentum for Dolby Atmos in music, we anticipate more services adopting it and deeper integration across mobile devices, PCs, cars, and headphones.\nGaming is another area where we see significant potential to bring Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos to a growing number of experiences.\nMicrosoft Xbox will be the first gaming console to support both Dolby technologies for games.\nXbox gamers will have more options to enjoy the Dolby experience with new gaming headsets released this quarter from Microsoft and Bang & Olufsen that feature Dolby Atmos support.\nLenovo recently launched a new gaming-focused mobile phone, the Legion Phone Duel 2, which highlights Dolby Atmos support.\nWe also witnessed the first eSports event in Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos this quarter.\nAs part of Blizzard Entertainment's BlizzConline, we enabled viewers to watch Overwatch matches in the combined Dolby experience through PCs and gaming consoles.\neSports offers unique opportunities to engage gamers by bringing Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos to the experiences they're passionate about.\nAs we increase the number of Dolby experiences in games, we enhance our existing value proposition and create more reasons for adoption on gaming consoles, PCs, and mobile phones.\nBy expanding our presence in music and gaming, we address two primary use cases for mobile devices.\nSimultaneously, we're discovering more ways for Dolby to enable the highest quality experiences across a broader range of content enjoyed on mobile devices.\nIn recent quarters, we've highlighted how we're enabling new mobile experiences, such as recording in Dolby Vision with the iPhone 12 or enjoying live sports content in Dolby Atmos through a mobile app.\nThis quarter, Earshot, a leading podcast service in India, became the first podcast app to support Dolby Atmos.\nThey will offer Dolby Atmos content across various podcast genres and in multiple languages.\nAs we continue to expand the relevance of Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos across a wider range of content, we address more use cases for mobile devices, driving reasons for deeper adoption with our partners.\nThis quarter, Xiaomi launched their first mobile phones supporting both Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos.\nThis adds to the growing number of partners offering the Dolby experience on mobile, highlighted by the Apple iPhone 12 lineup featuring the combined Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos experience.\nAdditionally, Samsung, OPPO, and Sony continue to emphasize Dolby Atmos with the launch of their latest flagship models.\nAll of this progress enhances our strong position in movie and TV content, which continues to drive more device adoption in the living room.\nThis quarter, Samsung released their Q7 soundbar, featuring Dolby Atmos support.\nIn the TV market, our global partners, including Xiaomi, Changhong, and Skyworth, released new models supporting the combined Dolby experience.\nIn addition to Dolby Atmos support, TCL and Hisense also highlighted Dolby Vision IQ support in their recent TV launches.\nDespite this momentum, we still see significant opportunities to achieve higher adoption levels for Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos in the living room, similar to the widespread presence of our core audio technologies.\nThe adoption of Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos on devices is driven by a steady stream of new titles enabled in the combined Dolby experience.\nOur streaming partners, including Netflix, Disney+, Apple TV+, and HBO Max, continue to make a wide range of titles available in Dolby, consistently highlighting the combined experience with the release of their latest major titles.\nTurning to cinema, as consumers return to movie theaters, they're seeking premium experiences, and Dolby Cinema offers the best way to enjoy a movie.\nCurrently, about 90% of our Dolby Cinemas worldwide are open, subject to certain capacity restrictions.\nOur engagement with exhibitor partners remains strong, as we recently added a new Dolby Cinema partner in China and opened four new Dolby Cinema locations during the quarter.\nWe're also seeing initial signs of strong box office performance from titles like Godzilla vs. Kong and successful local content in China, including Detective Chinatown 3 and Hi, Mom, all available in Dolby Cinema.\nWe look forward to anticipated titles later this year, including Top Gun: Maverick, A Quiet Place II, and Black Widow, which will all be available in Dolby Cinema.\nOver the past year, we've begun to bring the Dolby magic that powers the best movie, TV, and music experiences to a much broader range of content and interactions through Dolby.io, our developer platform.\nWe're focusing on deepening our engagement with the developer community, increasing the number of developers on the platform, and building their engagement with our APIs.\nJust last week, we completed an integration between Box.com and Dolby.io.\nBox users can now enhance their audio quality directly within their file storage, powered by Dolby Media APIs.\nWe're thrilled to offer unique solutions to Box's diverse customer base and increase engagement with Dolby.io.\nOur interactive APIs support various applications across industries, from online education to fan engagement platforms and even live streaming for medical teams.\nLooking forward, we see potential in combining real-time interactions with recorded media, allowing us to provide comprehensive solutions by integrating both our interactivity and media APIs.\nAs Dolby.io enables more new experiences, we're learning from developer interactions and adapting our offerings to support use cases with significant potential for high-quality media and superior real-time interactions.\nWe're gaining momentum in expanding Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos experiences to new content forms like music and gaming.\nBy extending our technologies to a wider range of content, we strengthen our position in movies and TV while creating more reasons for adoption across devices and services.\nDolby.io is allowing our technologies to address a broader spectrum of content experiences and interactions.\nThis gives us confidence in our ability to drive future revenue and earnings growth.\nI'll now turn it over to Lewis to discuss the financial details.\nMay the fourth be with you.\nOur financial performance was strong this quarter, with revenue and earnings exceeding our previous guidance.\nLet me provide some details for everyone.\nSecond quarter revenue reached $320 million, surpassing our guidance range of $280 million to $310 million, due to higher-than-anticipated volumes in several end markets and a $15 million true-up for Q1 shipments.\nYear-over-year, second quarter revenue decreased from $352 million last year, attributed to lower recoveries and reduced cinema-related business, partially offset by increased adoption of Dolby Technologies and higher market volume in areas like PC and TV.\nSequentially, total revenue declined from Q1 due to expected lower recoveries and seasonality.\nQ2 revenue consisted of $304 million in licensing and $16 million in products and services.\nLet's examine licensing revenue trends by end market, starting with broadcast.\nIn the second quarter, GAAP income tax was 10.6% while non-GAAP income tax was 16%.\nGAAP net income for Q2 was $76.2 million ($0.73 per diluted share), compared to $88.5 million ($0.86 per diluted share) in the same quarter last year.\nNon-GAAP net income for Q2 reached $94.8 million ($0.91 per diluted share), versus $106.6 million ($1.04 per diluted share) in Q2 of the previous year.\nBoth GAAP and non-GAAP net income surpassed our guidance due to higher-than-expected revenue.\nWe generated approximately $83 million in cash from operations in Q2, up from $66 million in the same period last year, ending the quarter with roughly $1.2 billion in cash and investments.\nDuring Q2, we repurchased about 760,000 shares of our common stock, leaving approximately $76 million in stock repurchase authorization.\nWe have declared a cash dividend of $0.22 per share.\nThe dividend will be distributed on May 25, 2021, to shareholders on record as of May 17, 2021.\nLet's discuss our future outlook.\nThree months ago, I predicted second-half revenues could reach the mid- to high 500s based on various factors and assumptions.\nWith Q2 completed, we now project second-half revenue between $560 million and $600 million.\nFor Q3 specifically, we expect total revenue to range from $260 million to $290 million.\nWithin this range, licensing could be between $250 million and $275 million, while products and services revenue might fall between $13 million and $18 million.\nRegarding market conditions, industry reports suggest PC TAMs could increase year-over-year in the second half.\nHowever, TVs and other consumer devices may see decreased TAMs in the second half due to last year's pandemic-driven demand spike, which may not recur this year.\nWe anticipate year-over-year organic growth in the second half, driven by wider adoption of our Dolby technologies across various markets.\nWe also expect higher revenue from our cinema-related businesses as the industry begins to recover.\nLet's examine the rest of the Q3 P&L outlook.\nQ3 GAAP gross margin is estimated between 88% and 89%, while non-GAAP gross margin is projected between 89% and 90%.\nProducts and services gross margin is expected to range from breakeven to $1 million positive on a GAAP basis and from $1 million to $2 million positive on a non-GAAP basis.\nQ3 GAAP operating expenses are estimated between $210 million and $220 million, while non-GAAP operating expenses are projected between $185 million and $195 million.\nThe increase in Q3 operating expenses is primarily due to marketing programs scheduled for the second half of this year, suggesting Q4 expenses could be at least as high as Q3.\nHowever, annual marketing expenses at the high end of our opex range would be similar to last year, just differently timed.\nWe'll provide an update when we report Q3 results.\nOther income for Q3 is projected between $1 million and $2 million.\nThe effective tax rate for Q3 is expected to range from 20% to 21% on both GAAP and non-GAAP bases.\nBased on these factors, we estimate Q3 diluted earnings per share could range from $0.15 to $0.30 on a GAAP basis and from $0.37 to $0.52 on a non-GAAP basis.\nWe announced today that Lewis has decided to retire later this year.\nLewis has been instrumental in strengthening our financial position, adapting to new business models, and supporting the expansion of Dolby experiences over the past nine years.\nHe has built a strong team and mentored many employees across the organization.\nLewis will work closely with me to ensure a smooth transition as we search for our next Chief Financial Officer.\nWe'll continue to benefit from Lewis's expertise during the transition period before he focuses more on his family.\nKevin jokingly suggested he said \"good riddance\" when first informed of Lewis's retirement.\nLewis acknowledged that his jokes might fall into the \"Dad Jokes\" category but expressed gratitude for the privilege of serving as CFO and the unique Dolby experience he's had.\nHe looks forward to a smooth transition and will happily watch the company's continued success from the sidelines.\nKevin agreed that no one has disputed the quality of Lewis's humor and assured that they would make the most of his remaining transition time.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:We are currently experiencing the COVID-19 pandemic.\nVarious factors, including the pandemic's intensity, duration, and scope, as well as governmental, corporate, and consumer responses, will determine its ongoing impact on our operations.\nThese aspects continue to develop and remain unclear at present.\nLewis will review Dolby's financial performance and provide our fiscal 2020 forecast, followed by Kevin's discussion of business operations.\nI trust you're all taking necessary precautions.\nI'm pleased to announce that Q3 revenues reached the upper limit of our projected scenario from three months ago, and our earnings surpassed the expected range due to a substantial tax benefit and lower-than-anticipated operating costs.\nAlthough we outperformed our Q3 outlook, it's important to note that the figures were lower than initial projections made at the year's start, before COVID-19 became a factor.\nLet's examine the figures.\nRevenue for the third quarter was $247 million, compared to $352 million in Q2 and $302 million in Q3 of the previous year.\nOur Q3 revenue forecast entering the quarter ranged from $225 million to $250 million.\nComparing our actual results to our guidance, revenues from TVs, PCs, and mobile devices were at the higher end, while consumer electronics and set-top boxes were at the lower end of our projected scenario.\nProducts and services reached the upper end of the range, but it's worth remembering that we had reduced our expectations by 70% to 80% due to COVID-19's significant impact on the cinema industry.\nExamining the total company performance quarter-over-quarter, revenue decreased by approximately $105 million from Q2, with about half attributed to timing of contract revenue and lower recoveries, and the other half due to COVID-19 impacts, including reduced royalties from unit shipments across various devices, decreased sales of cinema products and services, and lower revenue from Dolby Cinemas' box office share.\nComparing total company performance year-over-year, revenue dropped by about $55 million compared to last year's Q3, primarily due to COVID-19, with similar factors as mentioned earlier: reduced unit shipments, lower products and services sales, and decreased Dolby Cinema revenue.\nQ3 revenue consisted of $235 million in licensing and $12 million in products and services.\nLet's break down the licensing revenue by end market, beginning with Broadcast.\nBroadcast accounted for about 38% of total licensing in the third quarter.\nBroadcast revenues decreased by approximately 34% year-over-year, driven by lower recoveries and reduced unit volume due to the pandemic, despite increased adoption of Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos in TVs and set-top boxes compared to last year.\nSequentially, Broadcast declined by about 31% due to lower recoveries and reduced unit volume.\nMobile represented roughly 33% of total licensing in Q3.\nMobile increased by about 65% compared to last year, due to higher recoveries and revenues from patent programs, partially offset by pandemic-related unit volume impacts.\nSequentially, Mobile grew by about 3%, driven by recoveries but partially offset by pandemic-related unit volume impacts.\nPC accounted for approximately 10% of total licensing in the third quarter.\nPC decreased by about 4% year-over-year, due to lower recoveries and reduced unit volume, although it's worth noting that adoption of Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos in PCs has increased since last year.\nSequentially, PC declined by nearly 50%, due to timing of contract revenue and lower recoveries.\nConsumer electronics represented about 9% of total licensing in the third quarter, with year-over-year CE licensing down by approximately 29%, driven by lower volume and reduced recoveries.\nSequentially, CE decreased by nearly 60%, due to timing of contract revenue and lower unit volume.\nOther markets accounted for about 10% of total licensing in the third quarter.\nThey decreased by approximately 34% year-over-year due to significantly lower revenues from Dolby Cinema, as nearly all screens were closed for the quarter, and reduced revenues from gaming due to console life cycles.\nSequentially, Other Markets declined by about 16%, driven by lower revenue from Dolby Cinema and via admin fees (fees in the patent pool program we administer).\nThis was partially offset by higher recoveries in automotive and gaming sectors.\nBeyond licensing, our products and services revenue was $11.8 million in Q3, compared to $23 million in Q2 and $30.3 million in last year's Q3.\nWe anticipated a significant decrease in sales in this category, as most of this revenue comes from equipment sold to cinema exhibitors, who continue to be negatively affected by the pandemic.\nLet's review margins and operating expenses for Q3.\nTotal gross margin in the third quarter was 87.9% on a GAAP basis and 89% on a non-GAAP basis.\nProducts and services gross margin on a GAAP basis was negative $5.5 million in the third quarter, due to fixed costs not fully covered by the lower volume we experienced.\nAs a reminder, our guidance at the quarter's start projected GAAP gross product margin to range from negative $6 million to negative $9 million.\nProducts and services gross margin on a non-GAAP basis was negative $3.5 million in the third quarter for the same reasons mentioned in the GAAP discussion.\nOur guidance for non-GAAP product gross margin was negative $5 million to negative $8 million.\nOperating expenses in the third quarter on a GAAP basis were $182.9 million, compared to $209 million in Q2.\nQ3 operating expenses were about $8 million less than the low end of our guided range, primarily due to timing of certain marketing programs pushed into Q4, lower legal expenses, and reduced travel and outside services costs.\nOperating expenses in the third quarter on a non-GAAP basis were $159.2 million, compared to $188.4 million in the second quarter.\nThe Q3 non-GAAP total was also below our projected range for the same reasons discussed in the GAAP expenses.\nOperating income in the third quarter was $34.1 million on a GAAP basis, or 13.8% of revenue, compared to $34.3 million or 11.3% of revenue in Q3 of last year.\nThe third quarter of the previous year included a $30 million restructuring expense, largely due to prematurely ending a facility lease\nNon-GAAP operating income for Q3 was $60.5 million (24.5% of revenue), compared to $85.9 million (28.4% of revenue) in the same period last year\nQ3 saw a tax benefit of $27.4 million on a GAAP basis and $21.2 million on a non-GAAP basis\nThe Q3 tax figures include about $36 million in specific one-time benefits resolved during the quarter\nGAAP net income for Q3 was $67.3 million ($0.66 per diluted share), up from $39.6 million ($0.38 per diluted share) in Q3 of the previous year\nNon-GAAP net income for Q3 reached $87.5 million ($0.86 per diluted share), an increase from $79.3 million ($0.76 per diluted share) in the same quarter last year\nBoth GAAP and non-GAAP Q3 net income surpassed initial projections due to higher revenue, lower operating costs, and favorable tax outcomes\nQ3 cash flow from operations was approximately $134 million, compared to $91 million in the same period last year, with quarter-end cash and investments totaling over $1.1 billion\nDuring Q3, the company repurchased about 500,000 shares of common stock, leaving roughly $230 million available for future buybacks\nA $0.22 per share cash dividend was declared, payable on August 26, 2020, to shareholders of record as of August 17, 2020\nLet's examine the Q4 forecast\nThree months ago, when discussing Q3 guidance, I emphasized the current market challenges\nConsumer demand was declining, visibility was limited, and industry reports were inconsistent and outdated\nCurrently, we have updated TAM data for some markets, but not all\nCustomers still have limited visibility, and we won't have actual June quarter shipment data until reports come in over the next few months, plus economic uncertainty persists\nGiven this context, here's our Q4 scenario with key assumptions\nRegarding products and services revenue, primarily for the cinema industry\nTheaters are reopening more slowly than anticipated, so we don't expect significant equipment purchases from exhibitors in Q4\nWe project Q4 products and services revenue between $10 million and $15 million\nConcerning licensing\nWe estimate Q4 licensing revenue between $215 million and $240 million, compared to $235 million in Q3\nThe transition from Q3 to Q4 shows a downward trend due to revenue timing under customer contracts\nThis is typical Dolby seasonality, with higher revenue in Q2 and Q3, and lower in Q1 and Q4, largely due to contract revenue timing\nWe assume a modest increase in total unit shipments for Q4 compared to Q3 as consumer spending improves\nOur Q4 scenario assumes roughly a 5% increase in unit shipments across all device categories\nWe anticipate minimal revenue from Dolby Cinema box office share in Q4\nIn summary, our Q4 total revenue projection ranges from $225 million to $255 million\nCompared to last year's Q4 revenue of $299 million, the potential decline is mostly attributable to pandemic-related economic effects and lower recoveries\nQ4 GAAP gross margin is estimated between 85% and 86%, with non-GAAP gross margin about 1 percentage point higher\nProducts and services gross margin will remain negative in Q4, mainly due to fixed costs not fully covered at lower revenue levels\nAt the projected revenue range, Q4 GAAP products and services gross margin could be between -$6 million and -$9 million, and non-GAAP between -$5 million and -$8 million\nQ4 operating expenses are estimated between $187 million and $197 million on a GAAP basis, and between $167 million and $177 million on a non-GAAP basis\nOther income is projected between $2 million and $3 million for the quarter\nThe Q4 income tax rate is projected between 19% and 21% on both GAAP and non-GAAP bases\nBased on these factors, we estimate Q4 GAAP diluted earnings per share between $0.05 and $0.20, and non-GAAP between $0.22 and $0.37\nFor the full fiscal year 2020, revenue could range from $1,115 million to $1,145 million, GAAP diluted earnings per share from $2.04 to $2.19, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share from $2.76 to $2.91\nDolby's strong financial model, balance sheet, and value proposition position us well to navigate these challenging times\nOur team continues to innovate and expand Dolby experiences worldwide\nWhile Q3 revenues were at the high end of our projections, uncertainty remains in many of our markets\nThe pandemic has led to reduced consumer spending and shifts in new customer acquisitions and revenue timing\nHowever, our partners remain committed to enabling new Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos experiences\nAs consumer spending recovers, our strong position across various devices and services will help us resume revenue and earnings growth\nOur growth strategy has always focused on increasing the availability of compelling Dolby content\nThe adoption of Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos in movies and TV has driven increased adoption across a wide range of devices\nWe're expanding the Dolby experience into new areas like gaming and music, enhancing our value and creating more opportunities in mobile, PC, and automotive devices.\nWe're also starting to address a wider range of content beyond premium entertainment, recently launching our development platform Dolby.io.\nThese factors give us assurance in our capacity to achieve long-term growth.\nNow, let's review some key points from this quarter.\nAs streaming content consumption increases, Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos continue to be featured in the most popular content.\nThe much-anticipated releases of Hamilton on Disney Plus and Greyhound on Apple TV Plus are both offered in Dolby.\nThis quarter marked the debut of Dolby Vision titles on Google Play.\nHotstar, India's largest streaming service, began offering Dolby Vision for Disney Plus content.\nSeveral partners incorporated Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos into their products this quarter.\nApple, which supports these technologies across most of its devices, announced that AirPods Pro will support Dolby Atmos with iOS 14.\nSonos introduced the Sonos Arc, their first Dolby Atmos-compatible soundbar.\nFree, a major French Internet service provider, launched their first set-top box supporting both Dolby Vision and Atmos.\nLast month, Xiaomi released their first TV supporting both technologies.\nThe adoption of Dolby Vision and Atmos in TVs is growing globally, particularly in India.\nThis quarter, TCL, Sony, OnePlus, and Nokia all announced new TV models in India supporting both technologies.\nPanasonic also expanded their use of Dolby Vision IQ to more models.\nIn FY '19, Dolby Vision was included in about 10% of 4K TV shipments, and we're on track to significantly increase that rate for fiscal '20, with substantial growth potential still ahead.\nOur strong presence in movie and TV content has facilitated the initial adoption of Dolby Vision and Atmos in PC and mobile devices.\nWe see a significant opportunity to accelerate adoption by enabling more experiences on these devices, including gaming and music.\nRecently, Tidal significantly expanded the number of devices supporting Dolby Atmos music to include compatible soundbars and home theater equipment.\nWe're seeing examples of how Dolby Atmos can create unique experiences across various music genres.\nThis quarter, we saw classical music from John Williams and recordings from the London Philharmonic Orchestra mixed in Dolby Atmos.\nEmpire, an independent label, began releasing music in Dolby Atmos from artists like Fat Joe and Remy Ma.\nThe Dolby music experience enhances our engagement with partners and strengthens the value proposition for Dolby Atmos in existing device categories like mobile phones, while creating new opportunities in areas such as automotive and smart speakers.\nRegarding cinema, most theaters remained closed during the quarter, with a few regions slowly beginning to reopen.\nThe closure of cinemas worldwide has significantly reduced demand for our cinema products.\nWe believe that when cinemas reopen, exhibitors will highlight their premium offerings, and consumers will seek out the best experience, which is Dolby Cinema.\nLast month, the first Dolby Cinema in South Korea opened with our partner Megabox.\nWe've also added a second partner to bring Dolby Cinemas to Saudi Arabia, where our first site opened just last week.\nLooking ahead, we're excited about the unique opportunity to significantly broaden the content experience addressed by Dolby technologies.\nWe launched our developer platform Dolby.io this quarter, enabling developers to access Dolby technology to enhance media and communications experiences in their apps and services.\nInitial customers have applied our technology across various use cases, including podcasts, e-learning, and telehealth.\nRecently, artists can optimize their music recordings' quality with mastering on SoundCloud powered by Dolby's platform.\nWe're excited by the initial reception of Dolby.io and its potential to bring Dolby technology to the growing amount of media and communications content in our daily lives.\nIn conclusion, Dolby has a solid foundation with a strong business model, and people increasingly want immersive entertainment and communications experiences.\nThe quality of these experiences is crucial.\nWe continue to focus on increasing the number of devices supporting Dolby Vision and Atmos.\nWe aim to accelerate adoption and expand the device categories supporting the Dolby experience by enabling new forms of content like music and gaming.\nWe're excited about the opportunity to enable an even broader range of Dolby experiences, most recently with the launch of Dolby.io.\nAll these factors reinforce our belief in future opportunities and give us confidence in our ability to drive revenue and earnings growth.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:I am Pankaj Gupta, the vice president of investor relations at Dow.\nJim Fitterling, Dow's CEO and chairman, and Howard Ungerleider, the president and CFO, are also participating in this call.\nDow's 10-Q and 10-K forms provide comprehensive analyses of key risks and uncertainties that may lead to discrepancies.\nAll financial information, where relevant, excludes notable items unless stated otherwise.\nWe will also discuss non-GAAP measurements.\nThe agenda for our call is displayed on Slide 2.\nJim will start by discussing our third-quarter highlights and segment performance.\nHoward will provide modeling guidance and projections, followed by Jim's summary of our value growth strategy outlined at our recent investor day and why Dow remains an attractive investment option.\nLet's begin with Slide 3.\nDow achieved year-over-year and sequential growth in both top and bottom lines during the third quarter.\nOur proactive approach to storm preparation ensured the safety of our team and community, allowing for swift recovery.\nWe saw a 53% increase in sales compared to last year, with double-digit growth across all segments, businesses, and regions.\nSales also increased by 7% compared to the previous quarter.\nWe capitalized on strong pricing momentum, driven by tight supply-demand dynamics in our key value chains, and achieved 2% volume growth both year-over-year and sequentially, supported by robust end-market demand despite supply and logistics challenges.\nOur operating EBIT increased by over $2.1 billion year-over-year, with improvements across all segments and businesses, and $58 million higher sequentially.\nKey factors included year-over-year margin expansion of 1,170 basis points, driven by pricing momentum and demand growth, as well as increased equity earnings of $189 million from margin expansion at our Sadara and Kuwait joint ventures.\nOur ongoing focus on cash generation and balanced capital allocation resulted in operating cash flow of $2.7 billion, up $958 million year-over-year, driven by margin expansion from pricing momentum in key value chains.\nWe returned $918 million to shareholders through our industry-leading dividend of $518 million and $400 million in share repurchases.\nWe also reduced gross debt by over $1.1 billion during the quarter.\nOur proactive liability management actions, including tendering existing notes, have resulted in no long-term debt maturities until 2026 and reduced annual interest expense by more than $60 million.\nOverall, Dow continues to deliver on its priorities, and we anticipate further strength ahead as we benefit from a favorable macro environment and execute our disciplined strategy to decarbonize our operations and grow earnings, creating significant value for all stakeholders.\nMoving to our segment performance on Slide 4.\nThe packaging and specialty plastics segment reported operating EBIT of $2 billion, compared to $647 million in the same period last year.\nSequentially, operating EBIT decreased by $60 million.\nPrice gains in both businesses and all regions led to improved margins in the core business and increased equity earnings.\nSequentially, operating EBIT margins declined by 300 basis points due to higher feedstock and energy costs.\nThe packaging and specialty plastics business reported increased net sales year-over-year, driven by local price gains in industrial and consumer packaging, as well as flexible food and beverage packaging applications.\nVolumes decreased year-over-year due to lower polyethylene supply resulting from planned maintenance turnarounds and weather-related outages during the quarter.\nCompared to the previous quarter, the business achieved price and volume gains due to strong demand in industrial and consumer packaging applications, partially offset by hurricane-related outages.\nIn the industrial intermediates and infrastructure segment, operating EBIT was $713 million, up $609 million year-over-year, primarily due to continued tight supply and demand in both businesses.\nSequentially, operating EBIT increased by $65 million, and operating EBIT margins expanded by 50 basis points on volume and price gains in both businesses.\nThe polyurethanes and construction chemicals business increased net sales compared to the same period last year, with price gains in all regions due to tight supply-demand balances.\nVolume declines year-over-year primarily reflected the planned transition of a low-margin coproducer contract, as well as weather-related outages and third-party supply constraints.\nSequentially, the business achieved sales growth due to increased local price and volume from additional supply availability to meet resilient demand.\nThe industrial solutions business reported improved net sales compared to the same period last year, with local price gains in all regions.\nVolume increased year-over-year due to strong demand for materials in industrial manufacturing and energy applications.\nNet sales also increased sequentially, driven by volume growth, primarily in coatings and industrial applications from increased supply and local price gains in all regions.\nLastly, the performance materials and coatings segment reported operating EBIT of $284 million, up $209 million compared to the same quarter last year, as margins increased by 750 basis points due to strong price momentum and robust demand recovery for silicones and industrial coatings offerings.\nSequentially, operating EBIT increased by $59 million on price gains, leading to margin expansion of 210 basis points.\nThe consumer solutions business achieved higher net sales year-over-year with price gains in all regions.\nVolume increased over the prior year due to stronger consumer demand for personal care, mobility, and electronics offerings.\nSequentially, sales decreased as price increases in all regions were more than offset by volume declines resulting from planned maintenance and third-party supply and logistics constraints.\nThe coatings and performance monomers business delivered increased net sales year-over-year as higher raw material costs and tight supply-demand balances led to price gains in all regions.\nYear-over-year volumes decreased as the recovery in demand for industrial coatings was outweighed by weather-related disruptions and constraints in third-party supply and logistics.\nThe company achieved local price increases across all regions in succession, bolstered by higher volume due to sustained strong demand for acrylic monomers and architectural coatings, as well as improved supply availability.\nLet's move on to Slide 5.\nThe fourth quarter shows a continuation of strong demand growth across our packaging infrastructure, consumer, and mobility end markets.\nInventory levels for brand owners remain low.\nConsequently, we expect higher than usual seasonal demand to persist into this year's holiday season.\nIn the packaging and specialty plastics sector, we continue to observe resilient demand for packaging applications and our specialized functional polymers.\nGlobal polyethylene supply remains limited as the industry completes increased maintenance activities and supply chains recover from weather events in the U.S. Gulf Coast.\nWe concluded the third quarter experiencing higher costs for raw materials and energy, which we expect will likely continue through the fourth quarter.\nWe anticipate these costs to result in an approximately $350 million sequential increase.\nDow will continue to leverage our extensive geographic presence and industry-leading feedstock flexibility to help offset these impacts.\nWe also expect a $175 million benefit from turnarounds in the quarter as we finished our planned maintenance at our cracker in Canada.\nIn the industrial intermediates and infrastructure segment, ongoing consumer demand for furniture, bedding, appliances, pharmaceuticals, and home care products is expected to keep supply tight in our key value chains.\nDue to weather-related outages in the third quarter, some of our planned maintenance activities were postponed to the fourth quarter.\nSadara will also begin a turnaround at its isocyanate facility in the fourth quarter.\nIn total, we anticipate $100 million in turnaround impacts for this segment.\nShort-term increases in energy costs in the U.S. Gulf Coast and Europe are expected to result in an additional $100 million headwind in the quarter.\nWe continue to observe sequential recovery in industrial activity, particularly for energy applications.\nWe expect this recovery to persist at least through the fourth quarter as industrial production continues to ramp up from very low inventory levels to meet demand.\nIn the performance materials and coatings segment, demand for electronics, mobility, building, and construction continues to exceed supply.\nDemand for architectural coatings is also expected to remain high due to consistently low inventory levels throughout the value chain.\nGlobal production of silicones has been affected by recent dual control policy enforcement actions in China, with silicone metal prices nearly tripling from their previous levels.\nWe plan to advance a scheduled turnaround at a siloxane facility in Zhangjiagang, China, to coincide with government actions to restrict power usage.\nOur current estimate for the quarter includes $125 million from increased raw material costs and turnaround impacts.\nWe will continue working to mitigate the effects of rising raw material costs through our integrated position in both businesses.\nDespite higher raw material and energy costs in the fourth quarter, Dow will continue to capitalize on its advantaged global footprint, structural cost and feedstock advantages, and our diverse range of differentiated products to meet growing demand.\nOn Slide 6, looking ahead, we anticipate robust economic growth to continue.\nWith the Delta variant slowing the reopening of economies worldwide, there remains significant pent-up demand globally, particularly across our industrial and consumer end markets.\nMany industries continue to experience elevated order backlogs and low inventory levels as supply chains struggle to keep pace with strong demand.\nThese supply chain disruptions are expected to persist, which will likely prolong the ability to replenish inventories across most value chains.\nAs a result, we expect market conditions to remain tighter than forecasted, a view reinforced by China's recent dual control policy that has impacted both coal olefins and methanol to olefins-based capacity, which account for over 30% of China's total polyethylene production.\nGDP growth forecasts for 2022 are well above historical averages in most regions of the world as industries increase production to match robust consumer demand, with further potential upside as global chip shortages continue to extend the recovery in manufacturing.\nCollectively, G7 countries have not yet fully recovered to pre-pandemic GDP levels.\nThis suggests additional growth potential as economies return to more normal consumption levels with increasing vaccination rates, particularly in Asia, where levels remain low compared to the rest of the world.\nMoving to Slide 7.\nAt our recent investor day, we outlined how our differentiated portfolio and focus on sustainability-driven innovation will enable more than $3 billion in underlying EBITDA improvement across the cycle.\nOur restructuring program and digital investments will yield $600 million in increased EBITDA.\nBoth initiatives are in progress, and our restructuring program is on track to achieve its $300 million run rate by year-end.\nWe also have a range of higher return, lower risk, and faster payback capital and operating investments that will enable an additional $2 billion in EBITDA in the near term.\nOur investments to decarbonize and expand at our Fort Saskatchewan site in Alberta, Canada are also expected to generate approximately $1 billion in increased EBITDA.\nAs we've already mentioned, we're executing our strategy against a favorable macro backdrop that we expect will continue to support constructive market fundamentals for our key value chains.\nTurning to Slide 8.\nYou'll find a detailed list of these low-risk growth investments.\nOur capital investments are projected to generate $1 billion in EBITDA through incremental capacity expansions, debottlenecking, and enhanced feedstock flexibility across our operating segments.\nWe are making substantial progress already.\nOur Fort Saskatchewan expansion, which adds 65,000 metric tons of annual ethylene capacity to meet growing polyethylene demand, is now finished and will be fully operational by the end of the fourth quarter.\nIn 2022, our FCDH pilot plant in Louisiana will begin operations, offering 20-40% lower capital expenses and 5-7% lower operating expenses while reducing CO2 emissions by up to 20% compared to other PDH technologies.\nBy year's end, our debottlenecking project to increase aniline production by 60,000 metric tons annually will be fully operational.\nEarlier this year, we signed a memorandum of understanding for a new South China hub to improve local supply and formulation capabilities for the rapidly expanding Asia-Pacific market.\nWe recently completed a capacity expansion at one of our silicone polymer facilities.\nBy the end of the year, we will finish a new silicone sealant compounding unit to enable sustainable solutions for high-performance building and infrastructure applications.\nWe are advancing our 50 kt methacrylate investment on the U.S. Gulf Coast to support global end markets like inks, resins, and packaging materials, which is set to begin operations in the first half of next year.\nAdditionally, our operational investments are projected to generate another $1 billion in EBITDA as we enhance our production capabilities and shift our product mix towards higher growth and higher value markets.\nIn industrial intermediates and infrastructure, we're enhancing capabilities and shifting our focus towards higher-margin polyurethane systems for mobility and consumer applications.\nOur industrial solutions business is improving its ability to provide specialized materials for the textile industry.\nOur collaboration with Ralph Lauren on ECOFAST reduces energy usage by 40% and water usage by 50% in fabric dyeing.\nRalph Lauren aims to incorporate this technology in over 80% of its solid cotton products by 2025.\nIn performance materials and coatings, we're expanding our capacity to formulate specialized silicones for various attractive markets, including silicone adhesives for foldable displays in consumer electronics, thermal conductive silicone solutions for electric vehicles, and silicone solutions for 5G, where the market is expected to more than double in the next decade.\nWe recently partnered with customers on high-value innovations such as paper barrier coating applications using our award-winning Rhobarr polyolefin dispersion technology and Callaway's Supersoft golf balls, which feature a new hybrid cover made with Dow's paraloid-impact modifier.\nIn packaging and specialty plastics, we're improving our extensive conversion and testing capabilities to commercialize resins through packaging design, accelerating the innovation process, and expanding the addressable market for higher margin and more sustainable products.\nWe're already benefiting from the nine-layer blown film extrusion line project completed this year.\nWe're also investing to improve asset reliability, which will increase output and expand margins.\nWe're utilizing digital technology for customer trials and process automation to accelerate catalyst development for new resins and processes like FCDH, where we can typically be 100 times more efficient than conventional experimentation.\nCollectively, our near-term investments will generate an increase of approximately $2 billion in underlying EBITDA, and we plan to achieve this growth with a disciplined and balanced approach, maintaining our top quartile performance in cash flow, cost structure, debt reduction, and shareholder remuneration.\nLet's move on to Slide 9.\nThe strategy we outlined at our investor day builds upon our long-standing industry leadership.\nOur plan enables us to meet demand driven by sustainability factors, achieve zero Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions, and deliver significant underlying earnings and cash flow growth for years to come.\nOur approach to decarbonize our footprint and grow earnings involves a phased, site-by-site strategy that both retrofits and replaces end-of-life assets with low-carbon-emission facilities while also expanding our capacity.\nThis plan will achieve a 30% reduction in our CO2 emissions between 2005 and 2030 through a disciplined approach that considers timing based on affordability, macro and regulatory drivers worldwide.\nOur Texas 9 cracker demonstrates our ability to execute this plan effectively.\nTexas-9 has 60% lower carbon intensity than any asset in our fleet, without any specific design for carbon capture or hydrogen.\nThe project was completed with 20% better capital efficiency and 12 months faster than other crackers built during that period.\nOverall, the project has 65% lower conversion costs, consistently operates at over 110% of nameplate capacity, and has delivered a return on invested capital exceeding 15% since start-up.\nWe will apply key lessons from Texas-9 as we plan to construct the world's first net-zero carbon emissions ethylene cracker and derivatives complex in Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta, generating approximately $1 billion in EBITDA, as Howard mentioned earlier.\nThis project will more than triple our ethylene and downstream derivative capacity at the site while decarbonizing emissions for 20% of our global ethylene capacity.\nWe chose this site due to the availability of carbon capture infrastructure, advantaged feedstocks, and supportive government policies and incentives.\nOn Slide 10, as we pursue these attractive growth opportunities, we will maintain our balanced and disciplined financial approach since the spin-off.\nWe are committed to keeping capital expenditures at or below depreciation and amortization, well below pre-spin levels, while targeting return on invested capital above 13% across the economic cycle.\nWe will continue to align our capital spending with the macroeconomic environment, our affordability, and return targets.\nOur investments fall into three categories: First, we'll maintain our foundation and maximize the return of our existing assets while ensuring safe and reliable operations.\nSecond, we'll execute our pipeline of faster payback, lower-risk incremental growth projects for downstream and sustainability-driven applications growing faster than GDP.\nThird, we'll invest approximately $1 billion per year to decarbonize our footprint and grow earnings.\nThese investments allow us to meet increasing demand for low carbon footprint products while reducing enterprise risk through lower emissions assets.\nIn conclusion, on Slide 11, Dow is well-positioned to deliver significant long-term value for shareholders.\nWe have plans in place to both decarbonize our footprint and grow the enterprise as we achieve an additional $3 billion in underlying EBITDA, maintain industry-leading cash flow generation, and progress toward zero Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions.\nOur balanced capital allocation approach targets more than 13% return on invested capital, keeps capital expenditures within depreciation and amortization, and returns 65% of net income to shareholders across the economic cycle.\nAll of this is supported by our industry-leading portfolio, cost position, and strong track record of innovation that enables us to deliver differentiated products and solutions for our customers and a more sustainable world.\nOperator, please provide the Q&A instructions.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Rick Muncrief, our president and CEO, Clay Gaspar, our chief operating officer, Jeff Ritenour, our chief financial officer, and several other senior management team members are also participating in today's call.\nWe're grateful to everyone who has taken the time to join us for this call.\nFor Devon Energy, 2021 was a year of transformation, characterized by our pioneering approach to bold strategic consolidation.\nOur commitment to operational excellence, strict capital discipline, and the introduction of our industry-leading cash return business model, featuring our fixed plus variable dividend, were key highlights.\nThis deal was perfectly timed at the market's lowest point, laying the foundation for Devon's significant value creation throughout the year.\nWith this enhanced platform, we implemented our Delaware-focused operating strategy and achieved cost synergies resulting in $600 million in annual cash flow improvements.\nThese efforts to expand margins, combined with a disciplined capital allocation framework prioritizing value over volume, resulted in Devon generating the highest free cash flow in our esteemed 50-year history.\nThis substantial free cash flow allowed us to deliver on the primary goal of our shareholder-friendly business model: leading the industry in cash returns.\nAs illustrated in the graphic, we provided shareholders with substantial dividends, strategic share repurchases, and took significant steps to reinforce our investment-grade balance sheet.\nThe market rewarded this disciplined execution, with our stock price achieving the highest return of any company in the entire S&P 500 index during 2021.\nI'm extremely proud of our achievements and want to express my deepest gratitude to everyone involved.\nOur team comprehensively executed our strategy while responsibly providing our nation with a low-cost and reliable energy source, which is vital to our modern economy.\nWhile 2021 was a record-breaking year for Devon, the outlook for 2022 is even more promising.\nBuilding on our operational momentum, we've designed a capital program to efficiently maintain production at a very low WTI breakeven funding level of around $30 per barrel.\nCombined with the full benefit of merger-related cost synergies and a significantly improved hedge book, we're positioned to increase free cash flow by more than 70% compared to 2021.\nAs shown in the graph, this strong outlook translates to a free cash flow yield of 14%, assuming an $85 WTI price.\nClay will provide details of our operating plan later, but in short, we anticipate 2022 to be another excellent year for Devon.\nThe primary use of our substantial free cash flow is funding our fixed plus variable dividend.\nThis cash return strategy is central to our capital allocation process, enabling us to return significant and appropriate amounts of cash to shareholders across various market conditions.\nWith this unique approach, we've increased Devon's dividend payout for five consecutive quarters, and in total, we distributed $1.3 billion in dividends in 2021, representing a per-share increase of about two times that of 2020.\nImportantly, we expect our dividend growth to accelerate further in 2022.\nAs illustrated in the bar chart, we're on track to roughly double our dividend again in the coming year, equating to around 8%.\nI'd like to highlight that this attractive yield includes a substantial increase to our fixed dividend announced yesterday.\nThe 45% increase in the fixed dividend reflects our confidence in our underlying business and financial performance as we enter 2022.\nI'd like to briefly demonstrate how our unique dividend policy offers a compelling alternative for yield-seeking investors.\nTo illustrate this point, we've included a simple comparison of our estimated dividend yield in 2022 to other commonly referenced yields in financial markets.\nAs shown, Devon's yield of 8% is about six times higher than the S&P 500 index and significantly exceeds the current interest rate on a 10-year treasury.\nIn addition to our market-leading dividend payout, we're pleased to announce a 60% increase in our share repurchase authorization to $1.6 billion.\nTrading at less than five times cash flow, we believe our business is significantly undervalued, especially considering the structural improvements we've made to expand margins and returns.\nGiven this favorable situation, we've put our money where our mouth is by aggressively repurchasing $589 million of shares in the fourth quarter alone.\nWith the board expanding our repurchase program's capacity, we will continue to be opportunistic buyers of our stock throughout the upcoming year.\nFinally, I believe the diagram effectively summarizes what we've created at Devon.\nWe've assembled a high-quality asset portfolio and a team that has worked tirelessly to deliver on our commitment to expand margins, generate free cash flow growth, accelerate cash returns with our market-leading dividend payout, enhance per-share growth through opportunistic buybacks, and consistently strengthen our financial position.\nWhile 2021 was a record year, we're just getting started.\nAt Devon, we have the ideal combination of assets, proven management, the right team, and a shareholder-friendly business model designed to continue leading the energy industry in capital discipline and cash returns.\nWith that, I'll now hand it over to Clay to provide an overview of our recent operational results and upcoming capital plan.\nAs Rick mentioned, 2021 was a crucial year for Devon, showcasing the strength of our asset portfolio and the capabilities of our talented organization.\nOur team delivered results that surpassed production and capital efficiency targets across the portfolio while continuing to reduce per-unit operating costs and improve margins.\nResults are important, and while I don't take any of these accomplishments lightly, I'm equally proud of how we achieved these financial metrics.\nDespite the challenges of the merger, pandemic, and supply chain issues, we built a unified culture, adopted best practices from both legacy companies, and are now positioned to further leverage these collective wins.\nThe first key point is that there is no change to the upstream capital budget of $1.9 to $2.2 billion as disclosed last quarter.\nWhile inflation is undoubtedly a reality, our teams have done an excellent job working with our service companies, mitigating cost increases where possible, and quantifying the remaining impact on our forecast.\nA great aspect of a cyclical business is that if you're attentive, you should have a good idea of the most critical areas to focus on in anticipation of the next phase.\nAt this point in the cycle, we're focused on listening to our service company partners and helping them help us be successful.\nIn this very tight supply chain market, the key phrase we hear is \"predictable and reliable.\"\nYou'll notice that our 2022 program closely resembles our 2021 program.\nThis consistency allows us to signal to our service companies, midstream partners, and other key stakeholders to expect more of the same.\nThis predictability enables them to organize their supply chain operations, while the dependability assures them that we will fulfill our commitments.\nAt Devon, we value relationships deeply, and this practice of engaging with and responding to our key partners exemplifies this core principle.\nThe consistent level of operations in 2022 is expected to maintain our production at a range of 570,000 to 600,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day throughout the year.\nOur capital program in 2021 was highly successful, resulting in a 34% production growth rate compared to the first quarter of 2021.\nThis high-margin growth was achieved through consistent execution and exceptional well productivity, highlighted by several notable projects such as Danger Noodle, Boundary Raider, and Fiscal Cobra.\nEach of these successful projects surpassed 30-day rates of over 5,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day on average, demonstrating the world-class reservoir potential in the Delaware Basin.\nIt's noteworthy that the strong volume performance in 2021 was accompanied by excellent capital efficiency and significant additions to our proven reserves.\nWhile a single year's reserve bookings shouldn't be considered the sole measure of success, consistent and reasonably conservative booking processes can provide insight into the quality of underlying assets.\nBy the end of the year, our proven reserves in the Delaware increased by 18% on a pro forma basis, with these additions replacing over 200% of our annual production.\nIt's particularly impressive that our team added these reserves at an extremely low finding and development cost of only $5 per barrel of oil equivalent.\nThis outcome further demonstrates the advantageous and sustainable nature of our resources in the Delaware Basin.\nLooking at the map on the right, you can anticipate similar performance from us in 2022.\nWe have an excellent lineup of projects to execute, with most of our program focusing on high-impact opportunities in developing Upper Wolfcamp and Bone Spring zones, and to a lesser extent, the Wolfcamp and Avalon targets.\nTo implement this plan, we anticipate operating 14 rigs and 4 [inaudible] throughout the year.\nThis capital activity will be spread across our acreage, with prime locations in Southern Lea and Eddy County, and the state line receiving the majority of funding.\nThis level of activity will not only continue to boost Delaware production in 2022, but the advantages of our operational scale and best practices from the merger integration position us well to further enhance our execution capabilities.\nAs shown on the slide, the efficiencies gained in the Delaware have essentially doubled the productivity of our rig and frac equipment compared to just a few years ago.\nThese operational improvements have also significantly reduced our costs over time to approximately $550 per lateral foot in 2021, which is highly competitive in the industry.\nLooking ahead to 2022, I anticipate our operational performance will continue to improve.\nOur team consistently identifies new ways to leverage technology, operational breakthroughs, and industry best practices.\nInflationary pressure and supply chain disruptions are a reality in the current market.\nBased on current industry activity and commodity price projections, we've factored in approximately 15% higher costs compared to 2021.\nWe have been and continue to focus on consistency, planning, and staying ahead of these issues to react to any unforeseen challenges.\nThis approach will be even more crucial as the market continues to tighten.\nOn Slide 17, I want to highlight the momentum we're building in the Anadarko Basin, where we have a concentrated 300,000 net acre position in the liquids-rich window of the play.\nLeveraging the benefits of our $100 million Dow joint venture, we drilled over 30 wells in 2021 and initiated production on 16 of those wells during the year.\nAs illustrated in the charts on the right, the initial capital efficiency is excellent.\nUtilizing state-of-the-art completion designs and appropriately spaced developments, per-well capital costs have decreased by 25% compared to legacy activity, and well productivity to date has exceeded type curve expectations by 35%.\nGiven this strong execution, the returns we're seeing from this activity are competitive with any asset in our portfolio.\nBased on this success, we've decided to increase activity in the Anadarko Basin to 3 rigs in 2022.\nThis program will result in approximately 40 new wells coming online in 2022, allowing us to maintain a steady production profile throughout the year and generate significant free cash flow.\nCollectively, these assets generated over a billion dollars of free cash flow in 2021, and we're on track to produce a similar amount in 2022.\nThey also continue to offer some of the best returns in our portfolio.\nThe team has continued to identify additional locations and has leveraged company best practices to significantly improve our ESG footprint.\nOur Eagle Ford asset continues to deliver solid returns.\nThe team is doing some exciting work to unlock additional locations and significant refracturing potential.\nThe Powder River Basin has the most upside yet to be realized.\nOur team is making great progress in this regard by extending laterals to three miles and revamping the stimulation design, yielding very promising results.\nI'm proud of what these assets are delivering, and I appreciate the team's hard work and effort in fulfilling this important role within our portfolio.\nAs many of you know, we set ambitious emissions reduction targets last year covering various near, mid, and long-term priorities.\nTo ensure organizational alignment, we directly linked progress on these targets to our annual compensation program.\nWe've also dedicated a board committee to engage in our ESG goal-setting process, performance, and reporting.\nSince announcing these environmental targets, we've taken immediate action and delivered results.\nAlthough we don't have finalized figures for the past year yet, I can tell you our scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions will improve by approximately 20% in 2021 compared to our 2019 baseline, well ahead of the goals stated last summer.\nTwo key successes in reducing overall emissions are decreasing methane emissions and reducing flaring.\nIn 2020, we reduced methane emissions by 47% and flaring by 33%.\nI expect this positive trend to continue.\nExamining 22 specifically, numerous visible catalysts will drive significant outcomes, including advancing technologies for improvements and leak detection, enhanced facility designs, retrofitting facilities, widespread implementation of air-powered pneumatic controllers, and electrifying certain field operations.\nIt's crucial to emphasize that these initiatives aim to enhance both our ESG metrics and overall operational efficiency.\nBy concentrating on these operational achievements, we further align our organization's focus and enthusiasm towards ESG improvement.\nMy remarks today will concentrate on the primary factors influencing our 2021 financial performance and provide some perspective on our 2022 outlook.\nOur total production volume in the fourth quarter averaged 611,000 barrels of oil equivalent (Boe) per day, surpassing the midpoint of our guidance by 3%.\nThis production increase was observed across all products, with NGLs showing the most significant outperformance due to exceptionally strong processing and economics during the quarter.\nWe anticipate production to be approximately 570,000 Boe per day in the upcoming quarter.\nWe expect this to be our lowest production quarter of the year due to winter weather-related downtime that reduced volumes by about 15,000 Boe per day.\nAll winter-related curtailments have been resolved, and we don't anticipate any impact on our full-year production estimates.\nRegarding expenses, our lease operating GP&T costs exceeded 2021 at a rate of $7.25 per barrel.\nThis outcome represents a 1% decrease compared to the beginning of the year but was slightly higher than our forecast.\nAs anticipated, we experienced moderate pricing pressures across several service and supply cost categories in the quarter, and we also incurred a non-recurring charge to GP&T expense in the Eagle Ford.\nAn additional key variance was increased work-over activity, which contributed to our strong production results in the quarter.\nOverall, our exposure to higher-value production, combined with the low-cost structure, expanded Devon's field-level cash margin to $42.37 per barrel, a 14% increase from the previous quarter.\nRegarding corporate costs, we made significant improvements in this expense category in 2021.\nIn total, G&A and financing costs decreased by 31% year-over-year on a pro forma basis due to reduced personnel costs and the company's ongoing debt reduction program.\nThese structural improvements will continue into 2022 and provide ongoing benefits for years to come.\nLooking at the bottom line, Devon's core earnings increased for the sixth consecutive quarter to $1.39 per share.\nThis earnings momentum translated into an operating cash flow of $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter.\nAfter funding our disciplined maintenance capital program, we generated $1.1 billion of free cash flow in the quarter.\nThis represents a growth in free cash flow of over 400% compared to the start of the year following the WPX merger.\nThe primary use of our free cash flow is funding our dividend.\nAs Rick mentioned earlier, we announced a fixed plus variable dividend of $1 per share, payable in March, which includes a 45% increase to the fixed dividend.\nThis payout is the highest quarterly distribution in Devon's history.\nWe're also returning cash to shareholders through our share repurchase program.\nSince initiating the program in November, we've made a strong start by repurchasing 14 million shares at a total cost of $589 million.\nThis equates to an average price of $42 per share, approximately 25% below our current trading levels.\nWith the board expanding our share repurchase program to $1.6 billion, we now have roughly $1 billion remaining on this authorization, and we plan to continue opportunistically buying back stock in 2022.\nWe've also returned value to shareholders through our efforts to reduce debt and strengthen the balance sheet.\nIn 2021, we made substantial progress in improving Devon's financial position by retiring over $1.2 billion of outstanding notes, and we achieved our net debt to EBITDA target ahead of schedule, ending the year with less than a turn of leverage.\nAt current pricing, we expect our leverage to decrease further in 2022, potentially reaching a zero net debt balance by year-end.\nLastly, I want to highlight that our disciplined strategy is also resulting in excellent returns on capital employed.\nWe achieved a 20% return on capital employed in 2021, and we are positioned for this measure to increase significantly in 2022.\nThe rapid improvement we are delivering in ROCE, combined with our cash return framework, further distinguishes Devon from other opportunities in the market today.\nTo summarize, 2021 was an exceptional year for Devon.\nWe delivered on all our promises and more.\nAs we look to the upcoming year, I want to emphasize that our cash return strategy remains unchanged.\nWe will continue to focus intensely on delivering high returns on capital employed, expanding margins, accelerating free cash flow growth, and returning excess cash to shareholders.\nOur talented team at Devon takes great pride in leading the industry with this disciplined operating framework, coupled with the development and deployment of new technologies.\nIn simple terms, we are enthusiastic and prepared for 2022.\nI hope you can now appreciate how we've fulfilled the vision that Dave Hager and I, along with our respective teams, had when we announced our merger in September 2020.\nWe aimed to create something truly exceptional, and we believe we've accomplished that goal.\nWe'll now open the call for Q&A.\nPlease limit yourself to one question and a follow-up.\nOperator, we'll take our first question.\nSummary: ",

conversation.\nWe might reference non-GAAP financial measures that management uses to assess the business and believes will offer insights into ongoing operations.\nWe'll present highlights of our fourth-quarter results and current quarter trends.\nYou've likely heard from most of our industry peers by now.\nIt's encouraging to see positive movement in our category and industry, despite the current instability.\nWe'll touch on similar topics as others, such as gradual improvements as dining rooms reopened, off-premise growth, and digital expansion.\nThe main difference you'll notice is in our performance level.\nOur team has managed this pandemic exceptionally well by adhering to our strategy and taking bold steps to expand the business.\nChili's achieved substantial top-line progress throughout the quarter.\nWe generated positive cash flow for the quarter through our operators' careful margin management, which we used to reduce debt.\nOur debt is now lower than it was before the pandemic.\nWe maintained this momentum into July, with Chili's down only 10.9% by the end's month.\nIn the 84% of our company-owned restaurants with open dining rooms, we were down just 3.8%, and 36% of our company-owned Chili's locations had positive comparable sales for the month.\nThese results weren't due to a swift response to the crisis.\nThey were achieved by remaining committed to the strategy we've been implementing for over two years.\nWe had already made considerable progress in areas crucial for success in this environment: off-premise, digital, value, and scale.\nWe didn't need to scramble when the pandemic hit.\nWe entered it with seven strong quarters of performance.\nWe simply needed to maintain focus and push a bit harder.\nAs a result, we led casual dining, ranking first in sales and traffic for three consecutive months according to KNAPP-TRACK, and we're well-positioned for continued success.\nYou've heard how many restaurant companies are embracing digital to navigate this crisis.\nWhile Chili's is no exception, we've been at the forefront of the digital space long before the pandemic.\nWe've invested heavily in our digital infrastructure over the past decade, building guest connections and enabling quick responses to changing dining preferences.\nEnhancing convenience is a major aspect of how we utilize our digital capabilities.\nWe can tap into our 8 million member loyalty database, gain detailed purchasing insights from our tabletop devices, and continue enhancing our highly-rated app with features like one-tap reordering of frequently ordered items.\nLast year, we integrated DoorDash into our POS system and e-commerce platform, allowing us to shift our marketing focus from national TV ads to our digital platform, where we constantly test and refine to improve e-commerce conversions.\nConsequently, our digital sales of off-premise meals have grown from low teens to over 50% in the fourth quarter, with only a slight decrease as dining rooms reopened.\nWe've increased the frequency of our takeout and delivery services at a much lower marketing cost.\nThis exemplifies the advantages of a digital approach that enhances convenience for customers.\nOur ability to cater to customers wherever they are leads to increased usage of our services.\nHere's a unique achievement in our industry that you haven't heard from our competitors.\nDuring the final week of fiscal 2020, we accomplished an unprecedented feat in the restaurant industry.\nWe simultaneously launched our first virtual brand, It's Just Wings, in 1,050 Chili's and Maggiano's locations nationwide in a single day.\nRevenue is growing weekly, and we anticipate exceeding $150 million in the first year, potentially placing It's Just Wings among the top 200 restaurant brands.\nThe casual dining sector has long been considered oversaturated.\nWe see this as a chance to demonstrate that it might not be oversaturated, but rather underutilized.\nIt's Just Wings utilizes existing infrastructure, equipment, and workforce.\nDespite competitive pricing, marketing efforts, high-quality ingredients, packaging costs, and delivery partner fees, we're achieving strong profitability.\nThe brand attracts mostly new customers to Brinker concepts and receives highly positive feedback.\nCustomer satisfaction ratings are among the highest for restaurants on DoorDash, with high repeat business, and we're only at the beginning.\nWe developed this business within six months and launched it overnight with minimal investment in a consumer segment experiencing over 100% annual growth.\nGiven our scale, kitchen capacity, and exclusive partnership with DoorDash, we believe our potential for success in this area is unparalleled.\nWe're experimenting with additional virtual concepts and learning how to increase visibility among DoorDash users seeking food delivery options, while continuously improving our operations to meet consumer demands for speed, quality, and value.\nWe're proud to have two brands among the most popular on DoorDash, and we're enthusiastic about future opportunities.\nWhile normalcy hasn't returned for anyone yet, we anticipate a promising future for all Brinker brands.\nLast quarter, we committed to prioritizing the safety of our guests and staff while continuing to perform and gain market share, regardless of circumstances.\nI'm immensely proud of how our operators and support teams have fulfilled both commitments and how we're creatively and boldly shaping our future together.\nWhatever challenges lie ahead, our team's talent, brand strength, and operational scale position us advantageously.\nRegardless of how one might describe the recent quarter's operating environment, with several unfavorable terms coming to mind, our operators swiftly adapted to the pandemic's realities and exceeded expectations with their performance.\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020, Brinker reported overall comparable sales decline of 36.7%, though sales improved significantly as the quarter progressed, with June's consolidated results down 19%.\nBoth brands showed progressive improvement throughout the quarter, with Chili's leading the casual dining sector in comparable sales.\nWhile Chili's quarterly comparable sales declined by 32.2%, performance improved from a 51% drop in April during peak dining room closures to only a 13% decline in June.\nChili's outperformed competitors throughout the quarter, with comparable sales approximately 13% above the casual dining sector and traffic about 18% higher.\nOver 25% of our corporate Chili's locations reported positive comparable sales for June, a percentage that increased to 36% in July, as Wyman mentioned earlier.\nThe quarterly financial highlights included total revenues of $563 million, a restaurant operating margin of 6.4%, and an adjusted loss per diluted share of $0.88.\nThe $0.88 loss includes an additional $0.18 burden due to the timing of recording expenses for annual and long-term incentive compensation plans in G&A expenses, which is atypical for the fourth quarter.\nDuring this crisis, our team has excellently cared for guests and employees while effectively managing expenses despite significant sales decreases.\nOur managers have efficiently used scheduling tools to optimize labor hours in the current business climate.\nHourly labor and payroll tax showed favorable year-over-year variability, but total labor, including restaurant management, was unfavorable by 260 basis points due to sales deleverage.\nThe restaurant expense margin increased by 6.2% in the quarter, primarily due to sales deleverage.\nDespite reducing year-over-year spending by over $29 million, we achieved significant savings in advertising, repair and maintenance, and supplies related to on-premise dining, some of which we expect to continue.\nCost of sales improved by 30 basis points compared to the previous year, mainly due to favorable menu mix.\nAs mentioned earlier, our restaurant operating margin for the quarter was 6.4%.\nHowever, our operating margin improved throughout the quarter, reaching 12.2% for the June period, in line with our progress in top-line performance.\nWe anticipate further margin improvement as we maintain identified efficiencies, increase dining room capacity, and leverage sales from our virtual brand, It's Just Wings, assuming an improving operating environment.\nStrengthening the balance sheet is a crucial part of our financial strategy, and we are currently directing free cash flow towards debt reduction and liquidity enhancement.\nTo boost our liquidity, we conducted an equity offering in the quarter, raising about $139 million, which was used to pay down revolving credit debt.\nOur total debt balance at the fiscal year-end was approximately $1.2 billion, a reduction of over $220 million from the end of the third quarter, with revolving credit borrowings decreasing from $700 million to less than $473 million.\nOur liquidity, comprising cash balances and revolving credit availability, now exceeds $575 million.\nWe recently extended our revolving credit facility by 15 months, now maturing in December 2022.\nAs sales and cash flows improved, we resumed new restaurant development activities that were temporarily suspended early in the quarter.\nWe intend to open or relocate four new Chili's restaurants during the current quarter.\nRegarding operating guidance, due to potential volatility and uncertainties in the current operating environment, we are providing limited guidance for Brinker's consolidated performance for the current first quarter instead of our typical annual guidance.\nFor Brinker in the first quarter, we expect consolidated comparable store sales to decrease in the low to mid-teens range.\nWe estimate adjusted earnings per diluted share to be a loss between $0.25 and $0.40.\nWe anticipate positive operating cash flow, with weighted average shares estimated at 45 million to 46 million.\nIt's worth noting that fiscal year 2021 includes a 53rd week, which occurs during the fourth quarter.\nDespite pandemic-related challenges, our team has risen to the occasion.\nOur strategy focusing on value, convenience, and safety has been well-received by guests, allowing us to outperform competitors and positioning us favorably to continue gaining market share throughout the fiscal year.\nI deeply appreciate the hard work and dedication of our team members, especially those serving guests on the front lines every day.\nI am confident we will continue to demonstrate our ability to maintain progress and achieve long-term growth in both revenue and profitability.\nSummary: ",

momentum across all our business segments and our outstanding operational performance despite challenging circumstances.\nOur quarterly revenue surged 208% to $914 million, while the first half of 2021 saw a 112% increase to roughly $1.6 billion, both setting new records for our company.\nWe achieved record profitability, with adjusted EBITDA reaching $164 million for the quarter and $292 million for the first six months of the year.\nDespite ongoing COVID-related challenges, we remain confident in the long-term strategic position and impressive growth potential of this unique business.\nBefore delving into specific areas of our business, I'd like to commend our tour team for their outstanding performance this year.\nWe extend our congratulations to Phil and John for their victories at the PGA Championship and U.S. Open earlier this season, to Xander for his gold medal win in Tokyo, and to Annika for her commanding victory at the U.S. Senior Women's Open.\nCallaway Golf's tour staff has had an remarkable summer.\nIt's thrilling to see our players representing Callaway and our other brands, including TravisMathew and Topgolf, on golf's biggest stages.\nFrom a business standpoint, I'm certain this exposure is beneficial for our brands and will contribute to long-term shareholder value.\nLet's start by examining our golf equipment business.\nThe demand for clubs and balls remains robust as the sport continues to attract new players, driving unprecedented growth in package sets, junior clubs, and women's clubs, while core golfers are playing more frequently and showing strong enthusiasm for the game.\nGolf Datatech reports that rounds played in June remained at an all-time high, and retail demand continues to be elevated.\nDatatech's Q2 hardgoods sell-through increased by an impressive 40% compared to 2019, and retail inventory levels remain extremely low, with only 2.2 months on hand at the end of June as the industry supply chain struggled to keep up with the past 12 months of unprecedented demand.\nWith more activity options available this spring and summer compared to last year, we were cautious about a potential decline in golf participation or demand.\nHowever, we're pleased to report that we haven't observed this trend from our perspective in the market.\nWe're also monitoring supply chain disruptions caused by the resurgence of the coronavirus Delta variant.\nWhile the resurgence hasn't affected demand yet, it has caused further supply disruptions in factories based in and around Southeast Asia, primarily Vietnam.\nThe safety of workers in these regions is our top priority, and we're collaborating with suppliers to ensure operating conditions are and remain as safe as possible.\nWe've become accustomed to adapting to these circumstances over the past 18 months and can shift some production to less-affected factories.\nHowever, given the current lean inventories, the fact that nearly all our factories are operating at full capacity, and the need to shift production to next year's launches soon, these shutdowns will have an estimated $55 million negative impact on second-half revenues, primarily in our golf equipment segment and mainly in Q3.\nWhile disappointing, I view this disruption as a short-term issue that won't have a long-term impact on our value or strategy.\nOn a positive note, and I recognize this is an optimistic view, we now believe field inventory levels will almost certainly remain lower than expected throughout this year, which is generally a healthy market dynamic that bodes well for 2022.\nOverall, we're very satisfied with the strength of this category and our position in it.\nWe anticipate delivering record performance for our golf equipment segment this year, and perhaps most importantly, we continue to believe the outlook for the golf equipment category is highly positive, with both a larger total market and a higher embedded growth rate.\nNow let's discuss our apparel and soft goods segment.\nThe business had another strong quarter, surpassing our expectations as retail locations reopened worldwide and our brands remained top of mind for consumers.\nThis business significantly outperformed during the quarter and continues to see remarkable growth as we enter the second half of the year.\nTo provide context, in the second quarter, we saw more than 30% comp store growth in our own retail stores compared to 2019, the last period unaffected by COVID, as well as strong growth in sell-through at wholesale accounts and e-commerce.\nAn interesting fact is that we're not only seeing brand momentum among our target male audience buying for themselves, but approximately 30% of the direct-to-consumer sales we track are women buying for men.\nWhile I'm no expert, I believe it's a very good sign when women are choosing the brand for their partners.\nJack Wolfskin also performed well this quarter.\nThe business has faced additional challenges due to longer COVID shutdowns in Europe compared to the U.S., but the team has managed the issues brilliantly and is on track for a strong year.\nAs our owned stores in Europe reopened during the quarter, retail activity picked up significantly, almost reaching 2019 revenue levels.\nMost importantly, we experienced strong sell-through of the spring/summer 2021 line and strong pre-bookings for the spring/summer 2022 line, two crucial indicators of the brand's health.\nOur stores in China also continued to perform well as the brand maintains strong awareness and positioning within the outdoor apparel market there.\nThe Jack Wolfskin team has done an excellent job revitalizing this business and positioning us for strong top and bottom-line growth as COVID restrictions ease in the brand's key markets of Europe and China and as the brand grows and strengthens its appeal.\nLastly, our Callaway-branded soft goods business also showed strength, particularly in Japan, as the sport's popularity drove consumer spending.\nAdditionally, toward the end of the quarter, we reclaimed the Korea apparel business, which had been licensed to a third party for several years.\nAlthough that business is just starting up, we're very excited about the long-term opportunity it will provide to our soft goods segment, and the team did an excellent job managing this transition given the COVID travel restrictions and challenges.\nWith high demand levels across this business segment, we expect to enter 2022 with low retail inventory across all of our soft goods brands.\nIn summary, we are fortunate to be in excellent categories and are on track to deliver a strong 2021 in this segment as well as future growth.\nNow let's discuss Topgolf.\nQ2 marked the first full quarter of Callaway results with Topgolf included in our numbers, and they exceeded our expectations.\nWhile COVID concerns remain a challenging variable for venue operations, the team delivered outstanding numbers even as other options became available to consumers.\nWe continue to be energized by the momentum this business has brought to both Callaway's portfolio and to the game of golf.\nSame venue sales percentage compared to 2019 levels continued an encouraging trend of recovery, with Q2 results in the low 90s, up substantially from the low 80s in Q1 of this year.\nResults were driven by a combination of strong walk-in sales and continued recovery in the event business.\nLooking ahead, assuming no major restrictions from COVID upticks, we anticipate same venue sales for Q3 will surpass Q2 results, while we expect Q4 sales to be slightly lower than Q2 due to the corporate events mix in that quarter, with the full year ending at approximately 90%.\nTo provide context, this is considerably above our expectations for the year and, we believe, a strong performance.\nDomestic venue expansion continued as planned during the quarter, with four new venues opening.\nAnother venue, Holtsville, Long Island, opened recently, and Colorado Springs will open later this week.\nWe then expect to open one more venue in Q4 for a total of nine new domestic venues this year.\nBy the end of the year, we will have 70 owned venues in operation, including 67 domestic locations across three owned UPA venues.\nOur international business saw strong performance, with UK venues reopening successfully after Q1 COVID closures and our franchise venues building momentum despite ongoing pandemic challenges.\nThe overall venue business is performing exceptionally well, with profits surpassing our projections.\nToptracer had an outstanding quarter, installing over 2,000 bays and setting a new record as demand remains high and customer feedback is positive.\nDespite some COVID-related installation hurdles, we anticipate meeting or exceeding our goal of 8,000 new bays this year.\nA notable achievement this quarter was the installation of Toptracer at Golf Club Daiju near Nagoya, Japan, believed to be the world's largest driving range.\nTopgolf continues to serve as an entry point for new golfers, and we see great potential in marketing to these newcomers and creating synergies across our growing customer base both on and off the course.\nI remain optimistic about our future prospects as we move into the second half of the year and beyond.\nWe operate in thriving sectors with a diverse portfolio of businesses that are all surpassing our expectations.\nWhile we face macroeconomic challenges like supply chain issues, increased freight costs, staffing difficulties, and inflation, we view these as manageable given current and anticipated demand levels, and we expect to deliver strong financial results.\nWe estimate a $55 million negative impact on our top-line growth, primarily in Q3, due to current supply chain disruptions.\nTo address inflation, we have begun implementing price increases and believe we can adjust prices as needed.\nGiven the various factors at play for the rest of the year, we are providing guidance for both the third quarter and full year.\nBrian will provide more detailed figures, but the key takeaway is that we expect our full-year 2021 sales to exceed 2019 by over $1.3 billion, with adjusted EBITDA between $134 million and $149 million higher than 2019.\nOur 2021 EBITDA will be very close to our 2022 projection from last fall's long-term guidance, putting us roughly a year ahead of schedule.\nAs Chip mentioned, we are very pleased with our second quarter and first-half performance.\nAll of our operating segments exceeded expectations, leading to record results despite a challenging business environment.\nThe pandemic continues to present some short-term challenges, including supply chain constraints, higher freight costs, staffing issues, and inflationary pressures.\nHowever, we believe current demand levels and our ability to take action will mitigate these factors' impact, and we anticipate strong financial results for the year and foreseeable future.\nWe are excited about the opportunities ahead and feel well-positioned to navigate an extended pandemic.\nOur operating segments cater to outdoor, active, and healthy lifestyles that align with social distancing requirements, and we maintain a strong liquidity position.\nAs of June 30, 2021, our available liquidity, comprising cash on hand and credit facility availability, was $877 million, up from $483 million on June 30, 2020.\nWhen assessing our second quarter and first half results, consider the following: Our non-GAAP results exclude various non-cash expenses and one-time items related to acquisitions, impairments, and tax adjustments.\nWe have provided reconciliation tables detailing these items' impact on Q2 and H1 GAAP results.\nRemember that our first-half financials include Topgolf for only four months, as the merger was completed on March 8, 2021.\nExamining Slides 10 and 11, our Q2 2021 revenues set another company record, following a record-breaking Q1.\nQ2 2021 revenues benefited from the Topgolf merger, while Q2 2020 revenues were significantly impacted by pandemic-related business closures.\nIn Q2 2021, sales increased across all product segments and major regions compared to both 2020 and 2019.\nConsolidated Q2 2021 revenues were $914 million, a $617 million or 208% increase from $297 million in Q2 2020.\nThis growth was driven by a 98% increase in golf equipment and soft goods businesses, plus $325 million from Topgolf.\nFavorable foreign currency rates contributed $18 million to Q2 2021 revenues.\nCompared to Q2 2019, consolidated Q2 2021 revenues increased by $467 million or 105%, including a 37% increase in golf equipment and 21% increase in soft goods.\nFirst-half 2021 consolidated revenue rose $826 million or 112% compared to 2020 and $602 million or 63% compared to 2019.\nTotal costs and expenses in Q2 2021 were $806 million, up from $474 million in Q2 2020.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, excluding items like the $174 million non-cash impairment charge in Q2 2020, total costs and expenses increased by $503 million to $796 million in Q2 2021, compared to $293 million in Q2 2020.\nTopgolf added $301 million in total costs and expenses.\nThe remainder includes increased variable expenses, restored pandemic-reduced expenses, planned investments, increased corporate costs for a larger organization, and higher freight and inflationary pressures.\nSo far, the company's strong performance has generally outpaced cost increases.\nQ2 2021 operating income was $107 million, a $285 million increase from a $177 million loss in Q2 2020.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, excluding the 2020 impairment charge, Q2 2021 operating income was $118 million, a $114 million increase from $4 million in Q2 2020.\nThis growth was led by a $96 million increase in golf equipment and soft goods segment operating income, plus $24 million from Topgolf.\nFirst-half 2021 non-GAAP operating income increased by $167 million to $215 million, compared to $47 million in the first half of 2020.\nOther expense in Q2 2021 was $31 million, compared to $2 million of other income in Q2 2020.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, other expense was $27 million in Q2 2021, compared to $3 million of other income in Q2 2020.\nThe $30 million decrease was primarily due to $14 million higher interest expense from Topgolf in Q2 2021 and an $11 million gain from settling a cross-currency swap in Q2 2020.\nFirst-half 2021 non-GAAP other expense, excluding items like the $253 million non-cash gain from the Topgolf investment write-up, was $33 million, compared to $1 million of income in the first half of 2020.\nQ2 2021 earnings per share were $0.47 on approximately 194 million shares, compared to a $1.78 loss per share on about 94 million shares in Q2 2020.\nNon-GAAP earnings per share were $0.36 in Q2 2021, up from $0.06 in Q2 2020.\nQ2 2021 non-GAAP fully diluted shares were 194 million, compared to 95 million in Q2 2020, primarily due to additional shares issued for the Topgolf merger.\nFull-year estimated diluted shares are approximately 178 million, including the weighted average of merger-related shares over about 10 months.\nAs of June 2021, we had approximately 186 million shares issued and outstanding.\nQ2 2021 adjusted EBITDA was $164 million, compared to $29 million in Q2 2020 and $66 million in Q2 2019.\nAdjusted EBITDA from Topgolf was $57 million.\nIn the initial six months of 2021, adjusted EBITDA reached $292 million, compared to $89 million in the same period of 2020 and $159 million in 2019.\nTopgolf contributed $17 million in adjusted EBITDA over four months.\nLet's move to Slide 12.\nI will now discuss some important balance sheet and other financial items.\nAccessible liquidity, comprising credit facility availability and cash reserves, stood at $877 million as of June 30, 2021, up from $483 million at the end of Q2 2020.\nThis liquidity increase reflects strong performance across all business segments and improved working capital liquidity.\nTotal net debt was $1.1 billion as of June 30, 2021, including $652 million related to Topgolf.\nThe Topgolf debt includes $263 million in deemed landlord financing for venue operations.\nOur leverage ratios have significantly improved, with funded debt now below three times.\nConsolidated net accounts receivable grew 52% to $325 million, compared to $214 million at the end of Q2 2020.\nDays sales outstanding for the legacy business decreased to 58 days on June 30, 2021, down from 79 days a year earlier.\nThe rise in net accounts receivable mainly stems from increased Q2 revenue and includes an additional $9 million from Topgolf.\nWe remain confident in the quality of our accounts receivable.\nOur inventory balance decreased 12% to $335 million at the end of Q2 2021, compared to $379 million the previous year.\nThis $44 million reduction was due to high demand in golf equipment and better-than-expected performance in soft goods.\nTopgolf contributed approximately $14 million to inventory this quarter.\nCapital expenditures for the first half of 2021 totaled $96 million, net of expected REIT reimbursements, including $66 million related to Topgolf.\nThe full-year 2021 forecast for golf equipment and soft goods remains at $65 million.\nThe combined 2021 forecast for Callaway and Topgolf is approximately $243 million, net of reimbursements, mainly for new venue openings.\nThis excludes about $33 million in Topgolf capital expenditures from January and February before the merger.\nQ2 2021 depreciation and amortization expense was $43 million.\nNon-GAAP depreciation and amortization expense for Q2 2021 was $36 million, up from $8 million in 2020, including $27 million related to Topgolf.\nWe anticipate full-year 2021 non-GAAP depreciation and amortization expense of about $133 million, with $95 million for Topgolf.\nThis excludes roughly $18 million of Topgolf non-GAAP depreciation and amortization for January and February combined.\nMoving to Slide 13.\nWe are providing revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance for Q3 and full-year 2021, including 10 months of post-merger Topgolf results.\nFull-year revenue is expected to range from $3.025 billion to $3.055 billion, compared to $1.590 billion in 2020 and $1.701 billion in 2019.\nThis forecast assumes continued strong demand for golf equipment and soft goods, no further COVID-related disruptions, and Topgolf's 10-month segment sales approaching 2019's full-year level of $1.06 billion.\nThe outlook factors in $55 million of supply chain risk due to Southeast Asian COVID shutdowns, mostly affecting Q3 2021.\nFull-year 2021 non-GAAP operating expenses for golf equipment and soft goods are estimated to be about $100 million higher than 2019, $20-30 million more than previously guided.\nThis increase relates to variable costs tied to strong performance, accelerated investments in TravisMathew, and additional corporate infrastructure costs.\nApproximately 85% of the extra $100 million in expenses is expected in H2 2021, partly due to the Callaway apparel business takeover in Korea and normalized spending to support all businesses.\nWe anticipate continued cost pressures from increased freight and inflationary pressures through H1 2022.\nFull-year adjusted EBITDA is projected between $345 million and $360 million, assuming Topgolf contributes over $100 million for the 10 months post-merger.\nFor Q3, we expect revenue between $775 million and $790 million, compared to $476 million in 2020 and $426 million in 2019.\nQ3 2021 adjusted EBITDA is forecast between $51 million and $58 million, versus $87 million in 2020 and $57 million in 2019.\nThis growth reflects Topgolf revenue addition and soft goods segment growth.\nQ3 golf equipment revenue is expected to be below 2020 levels but above 2019 due to supply constraints and extraordinary 2020 H2 performance.\nThese Q3 supply constraints are not expected to significantly affect Q4 2021 or 2022.\nIn conclusion, while short-term COVID-related headwinds are frustrating, they won't impact our long-term value or strategy.\nWe're having an exceptional year, meeting financial goals ahead of schedule despite challenges.\nAll segments are performing well, the Topgolf merger has been highly successful, and we're well-positioned for the future in both COVID and post-COVID environments.\nWe remain excited about our growth prospects and opportunities ahead.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Today, I'm accompanied by Lal Karsanbhai, our President and CEO; Frank Dellaquila, our CFO; and Ram Krishnan, our COO.\nColleen, who comes from Automation Solutions finance, will be your primary contact moving forward as I shift to a new position in the operating business units.\nI sincerely wish you good health and success in your endeavors.\nLet's move on to the second slide.\nI definitely have a tough act to follow.\nAs Pete noted, I'm transitioning from my role in Automation Solutions finance, where I've worked at Emerson for over 13 years.\nI'm both thrilled and honored to join the Investor Relations team during this transformative period for our company.\nI'm eager to connect with all our investors and partners in the near future.\nI'd like to take a moment to highlight two significant ESG initiatives at Emerson.\nOn slide three, in line with our environmental sustainability framework of greening of, by and with Emerson introduced in February, we'll first discuss greening by Emerson.\nThis exemplifies how Emerson's solutions are crucial in supporting our customers' sustainability efforts.\nEmerson recently entered a multi-year agreement with PureCycle Technologies, which has developed an innovative process for fully recycling plastic number five polypropylene into clear pellets.\nFor those unaware, polypropylene is a common plastic that has lacked effective recycling options until now.\nEmerson will serve as their digital automation partner for upcoming plant projects in Ohio, Georgia, and a remote operation center in Florida.\nLet's move to slide number four.\nOur second topic demonstrates greening with Emerson.\nUsing our Helix Innovation Center in Dayton, Ohio, Emerson has partnered with the Department of Energy and Oak Ridge National Laboratory to develop next-generation HVACR technology.\nSome key areas of collaboration include expanding heat pump applications, redesigning refrigeration systems for maximum efficiency in food retail, and minimizing energy consumption and leaks in commercial HVAC systems.\nWe have numerous ongoing collaborations with the Department of Energy and their laboratories.\nWe're committed to strengthening these partnerships and supporting the creation of innovative solutions and practical sustainability strategies in the future.\nBest wishes and good fortune in your new role.\nWe're delighted to have you on board.\nColleen and I worked together in Automation Solutions for a couple of years, and we're fortunate to have her join our Investor Relations team.\nWe have considerable momentum and enthusiasm, which was evident in our performance over the past three months.\nI've had the chance to meet many of you over the last six months and look forward to connecting with more of you in the coming months.\nI appreciate your continued trust, your constructive feedback, and of course, your investment.\nI'd like to mention a few non-financial updates to the team.\nFirstly, we're making progress on our cultural initiatives.\nWe'll be announcing our new Chief People Officer later this month.\nWe're excited about the selection process.\nIt will be an external hire who will play a crucial role in helping us navigate challenges and create pathways as we evolve Emerson's culture for the future.\nSecondly, we've completed our portfolio review.\nWe're preparing to present it to the Board at the October meeting.\nWe briefly discussed it with the Board yesterday.\nIn essence, we've identified multiple strategies to drive higher underlying sales growth and diversify our portfolio.\nWe're all enthusiastic about the thorough process we undertook.\nWe explored many options, identifying broad markets with high growth potential and numerous opportunities for M&A and organic growth.\nRegarding M&A, industrial software remains crucial as we consider market share, potential for accelerating underlying growth, and various growth avenues.\nOur SI acquisition is performing exceptionally well, surpassing our internal synergy targets.\nHowever, what impresses me most is the team's execution.\nWhile market tailwinds played a role, particularly in Automation Solutions and across our Commercial & Residential businesses, the execution was truly outstanding.\nThe team overcame numerous challenges during the quarter, including material inflation, supply issues, logistics complications, and labor shortages in the US.\nDespite these operational hurdles, we're seeing the value of this work reflected in the company's incremental profits.\nThe strong operating profit leverage of 34% has created room to accelerate investment in differentiating technologies, which will further increase our relevance to our customer base.\nWe've already begun these investments, and I'll share more details about them as we progress through the year.\nWe're particularly pleased with the quarterly results, especially considering the operational challenges Lal described and Ram will discuss later in the call.\nPlease turn to slide six.\nThe ongoing recovery in our end markets, combined with the benefits of our cost reset actions, led to strong operational performance and financial results in the third quarter.\nAdjusted earnings per share reached $1.09, a 36% increase from last year.\nDemand continues to strengthen, with sales exceeding our expectations, showing 15% underlying growth, and June trailing 3-month orders at 26%.\nNotably, Automation Solutions turned positive this quarter in both sales and orders, with 9% sales growth and 17% underlying order growth.\nCommercial & Residential Solutions continues to experience robust demand across all businesses and regions, with 29% sales growth and 43% order growth on an underlying basis.\nWe continue to realize the benefits of our cost reset initiatives as planned, which, along with increased volume and leverage, drove adjusted segment EBIT growth of 40% and a 280 basis point increase in margin to 19.6%.\nCash flow remains very strong, with operating and free cash flow up approximately 30% year-over-year and free cash flow conversion exceeding 150% of net earnings.\nWe're continuing to implement the remaining elements of the cost reset program.\nThis quarter, we initiated $32 million in restructuring actions.\nThe program is on schedule and delivering the projected savings as planned.\nThis chart bridges the earnings per share increase from the previous year.\nOperational performance was very strong, as evidenced by the green bar.\nOperations contributed 33% to adjusted EPS, with balanced performance between the platforms.\nBoth divisions achieved substantial profit leverage due to increased volume and cost reduction benefits, as mentioned by Lal.\nThe enterprise-wide leverage was 34%.\nFactors such as taxes, currency fluctuations, pension costs, and stock compensation resulted in a $0.05 negative impact, while share repurchases had a small positive effect.\nOverall, adjusted earnings per share grew by 36% to $1.09.\nPlease refer to Chart 8 for the next section.\nAs previously stated, underlying sales increased by 15%.\nGross profit rose by 90 basis points to 42.4%, primarily due to cost reduction measures and volume leverage across the company.\nWe managed to offset the impact of price/cost pressures, which are intensifying and will be more evident in the coming quarters, as we'll discuss later in this call.\nThe adjusted EBIT margin improved by 310 basis points to 18.4%.\nThe effective tax rate was 19.2% compared to 11% in the previous year.\nLast year, we benefited from several favorable discrete items, mainly related to R&D credits, which we explained at the time.\nThis resulted in a $0.10 year-over-year headwind that we were able to overcome.\nAs mentioned earlier, adjusted EPS reached $1.09, up from $0.80 last year.\nLet's move to slide nine to discuss earnings and cash flow.\nAdjusted segment EBIT grew by 40%, with margins improving by 280 basis points.\nVolume leverage and cost reset benefits offset material cost headwinds in the Climate Technologies division.\nAdjusted pre-tax earnings increased by 350 basis points to 17.6%.\nOperating cash flow was robust, rising 31% to $1.1 billion.\nFree cash flow reached $977 million, also up by over 30%, driven by strong earnings growth and effective working capital management.\nFinally, the trade working capital ratio improved to 15.4% of sales.\nNow, let's examine Automation Solutions on slide 10.\nUnderlying sales turned positive this quarter, growing by 8%.\nTrailing 3-month orders accelerated to 17%.\nThe improvement in the Americas is particularly encouraging, with continued momentum in life sciences, food and beverage, and medical markets, as well as renewed growth across traditional process automation markets and sustainability-related business.\nWe're observing increased KOB three activity among our process automation customers, primarily driven by shutdown turnaround and outage activity and operational expenditure.\nMRO spending is returning to pre-pandemic levels due to pent-up demand and delayed STOs.\nCapital expenditure is recovering at a slower pace, with positive influences from site-based emissions and optimization projects.\nThe platform continues to implement comprehensive restructuring actions, and the benefits are reflected in the financial results.\nAdjusted EBIT margin increased by 320 basis points, and adjusted EBITDA improved by 310 basis points, mainly due to cost reset savings and volume leverage.\nThe integration of OSI is progressing exceptionally well.\nWe're very satisfied with the acquisition and its results so far, and we have growing confidence in our synergy plan.\nBacklog increased to $5.5 billion, up 17% year-to-date.\nWe'll discuss the project pipeline and other opportunities later in the call.\nLet's review Commercial & Residential Solutions on slide 11.\nUnderlying sales grew by 29% compared to the previous year.\nOrders continue to be strong and broadly based.\nThe June trailing 3-month underlying orders were up 43%, with balanced growth across both Climate Technologies and Tools & Home products.\nAll our businesses and regions experienced strong double-digit growth.\nResidential markets remain robust, and growth has accelerated in Cold Chain and Professional Tools.\nThe Americas saw a 29% increase, with continued strength across all end markets.\nEurope grew by 37%, driven by ongoing heat pump demand and rising sales of professional tools.\nAsia, Middle East, and Africa increased by 25%, propelled by Cold Chain and various heating technologies.\nMargins improved by 170 basis points for adjusted EBIT and 120 basis points for adjusted EBITDA, driven by strong volume leverage and cost reset savings, which more than offset the price/cost headwinds in the business.\nI'll now hand over to Ram, who will discuss operations, our quarterly performance, and some of the challenges we face.\nOur operating environment remains challenging due to commodity inflation, electronic supply issues, and labor availability affecting our global operations.\nSteel prices have reached record highs after 11 consecutive months of increases and, in our estimation, have not yet peaked.\nPlastic resin prices remain high as our global teams work quickly to find alternatives to maintain supply.\nAlthough copper prices have decreased from record highs, they are still up over $1.40 per pound year-over-year.\nOur hedge positions mitigated the impact in 2021, but the inflationary effect of copper will continue into most of 2022.\nElectronics shortages are widespread in most of our businesses, impacting both platforms, and supply is expected to remain constrained well into 2022.\nThere is very little component inventory for microprocessors, controllers, and linear integrated circuits in the open market, and our EMS suppliers are facing an increasing number of shortages, severely impacting lead times.\nLabor availability continues to be a challenge across many U.S. industries, including our businesses.\nThe rapid demand recovery in many of our Commercial & Residential Solutions businesses, local competition driven by tight labor markets in many cities, and intermittent labor constraints due to COVID-19 disruptions have added complexity to our operational plans.\nIt's important to note that the unfavorable price/cost impact remains at $75 million, as estimated last quarter.\nThis hasn't changed, but we expect the maximum impact of commodity inflation to be felt in the next two quarters.\nDespite these challenges, I'd like to highlight some of the outstanding work by our global supply chain and operations teams on slide 13.\nThey have combated these challenges and helped deliver exceptional operational results to date by remaining flexible, creative, and agile in a dynamic environment to meet our customers' needs.\nOur supply chain teams have worked tirelessly to ensure continuity of material supply to our global plants.\nAs shown in the chart, many innovative solutions are being implemented quickly and effectively in real-time.\nOur regional footprint in both manufacturing and supply chain, which we've developed over many years, has been a significant advantage during these challenging times.\nMany of our global plants are producing at record levels while increasing capacity to meet surge demand and, in many cases, in-sourcing critical elements of the supply chain to address sudden disruptions.\nNow, let's turn to slide 15 for our updated outlook for the year.\nWe are improving our sales forecast based on the continued strength in orders, business pace, and year-to-date profit performance.\nWe now expect underlying sales growth to be near the top of our May guidance of approximately 5% to 6%.\nCommercial Residential is projected to exceed their May range at 15% to 16%, while Automation Solutions is expected to be closer to the top of its range at 0% to 1%.\nThe strong volume and improved cost base will translate into better margins.\nOur estimates are now 50 basis points above the previous guidance, increasing adjusted EBIT margin and adjusted EBITDA by 0.5% to approximately 18% and 23%, respectively.\nThere are no changes to restructuring, tax rate, capital expenditure, or dividend projections.\nRobust profitability and working capital performance led to a $300 million increase in both our operating cash flow and free cash flow projections.\nWe are elevating our adjusted earnings per share guidance to $4.07, give or take $0.01.\nOur estimated price/cost headwind of $75 million for 2021 remains unchanged from Q2 despite current challenges.\nWe are addressing this through containment and targeted price adjustments, but upcoming market developments will pose challenges in the next two quarters.\nThe impact of stock compensation is now projected to be $125 million.\nLet's examine Chart 16 to review the order trends over the past three months.\nEmerson's three-month order rates remain robust, with Commercial & Residential Solutions continuing to improve and Automation Solutions showing significant positive growth in June.\nCommercial & Residential Solutions continues to exhibit strength in Residential, Cold Chain, and Professional Tools sectors, all approaching the 43% average.\nAutomation Solutions sees ongoing strength in discrete and hybrid markets, with recovery in process automation, particularly in North America.\nKOB three and two are leading the recovery, with some KOB one activity emerging in chemicals, power, and biofuels.\nThe Americas region showed significant improvement, up 29%, driven by deferred maintenance demand and increased site access.\nThe life sciences sector continues to demonstrate exceptional momentum.\nNow, let's review Chart 17 for the underlying sales growth outlook.\nQ3 underlying sales increased by 15% year-over-year, surpassing management expectations due to strong performance in Commercial & Residential Solutions and North American recovery.\nWe project full-year underlying sales growth between 5% and 6%, at the upper end of our previous 3% to 6% guidance, with total sales of about $18.4 billion.\nWe anticipate fourth-quarter growth in the high single to low double-digit range.\nFor the remainder of the year, we expect continued recovery in North American Automation Solutions and broad strength in Commercial & Residential Solutions, though supply chain and labor issues will present challenges.\nFor the full year, we project Automation Solutions sales to be flat to 1% growth, and Commercial & Residential Solutions to grow between 15% and 16%, resulting in our overall 5% to 6% underlying sales growth expectation.\nIn the Americas, we anticipate strong Q4 growth of about 20% in Automation Solutions, with broad-based recovery across industries, led by discrete and hybrid sectors.\nProcess automation shows uneven recovery, with domestic oil demand strength offset by reduced midstream investment and continued upstream fiscal restraint.\nWe expect increased KOB 3 spending for deferred maintenance and site access, with a strong fall shutdown and turnaround season anticipated.\nLatin America should see continued strength in mining industries.\nIn Commercial & Residential, we expect ongoing momentum in residential markets, driven by DIY trends, home starts, and HVAC seasonality, as well as strength in Professional Tools and Cold Chain.\nEurope will see continued demand in life sciences and biofuels for automation, with project wins in power, midstream, downstream, and sustainability driving low to mid-single-digit Q4 growth.\nCommercial & Residential will experience robust demand for heat pumps and professional tools, along with continued refrigeration market recovery.\nIn Asia, Middle East, and Africa, automation business is seeing healthy project activity in marine, nuclear, life sciences, and semiconductors, with positive site-level spending trends in the Middle East.\nCommercial & Residential is experiencing commercial recovery across the region, particularly in commercial AC and cold chain solutions.\nOngoing COVID restrictions remain a challenge, especially in this region.\nLet's review Chart 19 for the Automation Solutions business funnel.\nOur traditional large project funnel, valued at $6.4 billion in February, has seen approximately $80 million in bookings, including LNG and a notable project in Mexico.\nNew projects added include clean fuels, hydrogen, renewable diesels, lithium mining, and LNG, while removed projects were mostly oil and gas and downstream refining.\nThe August 2021 funnel is now valued at $6.3 billion across about 180 projects.\nWe've identified new decarbonization opportunities worth $400 million across approximately 120 projects, bringing the combined funnel value to $6.7 billion.\nThe OSI acquisition has introduced opportunities in transmission and distribution automation, valued at $1.5 billion across 530 projects.\nAbout 15% of this $1.5 billion is valued at over $5 million, and 50% is between $1 million and $5 million.\nThe funnel is global, with approximately $1 billion in North America and Europe.\nOverall, we have strong opportunities ahead as we diversify and expand into new areas.\nChart 20 highlights our robust cost reset plan, which began in late 2019 and will be fully realized by 2023.\nThe plan involves over $600 million in spend and approximately $650 million in savings.\nWe're on track to reach our midrange targets of 24% adjusted EBITDA margins and $4.75 to $5 in adjusted EPS by 2023.\nRecent outperformance is creating room for critical investments in key technologies.\nRevenues, margins, and cash flow are exceeding February expectations, enabling acceleration in technology investments.\nExamples include the Copeland K7 scroll for air conditioning, Greenlee remote cutters for underground cable cutting, the Gemini next-generation pressure and temperature device, and Plantweb Optics, an integrated operational performance platform.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:A recording of today's discussion will be accessible via telephone and our website.\nIn fairness to all participants, please restrict yourself to a single inquiry and one additional follow-up question.\nI'd like to inform you that we're organizing an Investor Day in early April, with more details to be provided in the near future.\nI'll now hand over the conversation to Phil Snow.\nAllow me to begin by extending a warm welcome to Kendra, who has recently taken on the role of FactSet's Head of Investor Relations.\nKendra has been with FactSet for over 20 years, most recently serving as my Chief of Staff.\nShe brings extensive company knowledge and industry insight to her new position.\nI'm eager to collaborate with Kendra in further developing our Investor Relations program.\nWe're thrilled to have her on board and have already started utilizing her profound financial and operational expertise as we continue to implement our growth strategy.\nMoving on to our results.\nFactSet has begun fiscal 2022 on a strong note, and I'm delighted to report that this quarter saw the highest Q1 incremental ASV ever recorded.\nContinuing the momentum from Q4, we achieved a 9% year-over-year growth in organic ASV plus professional services in Q1.\nThe impressive performance of our sales and client-facing teams carried over from Q4, accelerating the implementation of our go-to-market strategy.\nThese teams continue to drive higher retention and expansion rates among existing clients, while also securing a significant number of new business deals.\nInstitutional asset management clients were the primary contributors to this quarter's growth, as we continue to see strong performance in our workstation and accelerating growth in our analytics workflow solutions.\nThe past two years of accelerated investment in content and technology continue to drive top-line growth.\nWe're experiencing increased demand for unique content and workflow solutions.\nFactSet's leading open content and analytics platform is enabling us to meet this demand and capture a larger share of our clients' budgets.\nAcross client types, our wins were widespread.\nWe observed double-digit ASV growth rates from our banking, wealth, hedge fund, and corporate clients, as well as private equity and venture capital funds and partners.\nOur investments in content and technology, including deep sector, wealth, and analytics solutions, continue to support client retention rates and renewals across all sectors.\nOverall, we're pleased that our performance resulted in a 13% increase in adjusted earnings per share compared to the same period last year.\nOur adjusted operating margin of 33.6% exceeds our projected guidance.\nLinda will provide more details shortly.\nWe're now in the final year of our multi-year investment plan and remain on track to achieve our objectives.\nOur focus is on our digital platform, scaling our content refinery, and creating highly personalized workflow solutions.\nWithin our content refinery, ESG, data for wealth, private markets, and deep sector are all driving workstation growth.\nWe continue to expand our deep sector data, launching real estate and technology, media, and telecom in November.\nDeep sector and our investments in private markets have led to growth and high retention within sell-side firms.\nOur recent acquisition of Cobalt further advances our private market strategy by linking unique data with tracking and portfolio monitoring, providing value to our private equity and venture capital clients.\nOur workflow solutions, which enhance efficiencies across front, middle, and back offices, continue to contribute significant ASV.\nOur analytics APIs are resonating with clients, and we're increasingly integrating with cloud-based platforms.\nEarlier this month, we introduced over 90 datasets and numerous APIs on Amazon Data Exchange, becoming the first major data and analytics provider to do so.\nOur trading business continues to grow, bolstered by the recent addition of fixed income support for trade execution.\nThis enables our clients to uncover new insights and trade across asset classes with greater speed and efficiency, significantly contributing to the growth of our analytics and trading business during the quarter.\nOur product teams are concentrating on creating, developing, and implementing customized workflow solutions tailored to each client type.\nThis approach has proven highly effective in the wealth sector, with our Advisor Dashboard maintaining a strong pipeline and robust client engagement for the fiscal year 2022.\nWe view this level of customization as a key competitive advantage and are dedicated to collaborating with our clients to enhance our offerings.\nAcross all our regions, we observed sustained strength in ASV growth throughout our markets.\nThe Americas made the largest contribution, with organic ASV growth accelerating to 9%, supported by widespread strength across our business lines.\nThis growth was fueled by high retention rates and expansion among asset managers and asset owners.\nThe region also benefited from successfully implementing higher price increases.\nIn EMEA, growth picked up to 7%, showing consistent improvement over the last three quarters.\nResearch and advisory services had a particularly positive impact, driven by improved retention among asset managers and wealth clients, as well as strong workstation sales to new customers.\nAsia Pacific experienced another strong quarter with growth accelerating to 14%, primarily driven by CTS.\nWe continued to secure wins across numerous countries, with hedge funds, asset managers, and asset owners driving ASV growth.\nTo summarize, I'm impressed with the FactSet team for delivering such strong results at the beginning of the year.\nThe first quarter is typically a slower start to the fiscal year and doesn't necessarily indicate our performance for the remainder of the year.\nNevertheless, our momentum from Q4 has persisted, and we are well-positioned to achieve our targets for the year.\nConsequently, we are reaffirming our fiscal 2022 guidance and remain confident in our pipeline and the value we are providing to our clients.\nMoving forward, we continue to focus on three strategic priorities: expanding our content refinery, improving the client experience through highly personalized solutions, and delivering next-generation workflow solutions for clients.\nWe believe that our people, culture, and performance-driven mindset will enable us to execute these priorities as we accelerate the pace of change.\nWe are dedicated to investing in and developing our team's talent, experience, and skills as we build the industry's leading open content and analytics platform.\nLastly, an important milestone in our company's history occurred earlier this week when FactSet was included in the S&P 500 Index.\nOur addition was actually predicted by our S&P 500 constituents prediction signal on October 1st.\nOur inclusion is a proud moment for FactSet and a testament to our significant growth and our efforts to help our clients perform their best work.\nOur team's creativity, dedication, and collaborative spirit make us a trusted partner, and I'm extremely proud of their drive to create smarter, more innovative solutions for our clients.\nI'm delighted to be here today as part of the FactSet team.\nAlthough I've only been with FactSet for a few months, it's become evident that the company has been performing exceptionally well, from accelerating top-line growth and strong free cash flow generation to its long history of consistent and growing shareholder returns, and there's still significant potential ahead as the investments made over the past two years are paying off and driving growth.\nThere is undoubtedly a wealth of talent throughout the organization.\nI'm excited to work with the team to build upon FactSet's history of outstanding performance while generating substantial value for shareholders.\nI will now provide more details on our first quarter performance.\nStarting with ASV, we achieved 9% growth in organic ASV plus professional services.\nAs Phil mentioned earlier, we typically experience a seasonal slowdown in Q1.\nOur performance reflects increased demand for our content and products, higher retention rates, and our ability to implement higher pricing.\nThe market has been favorable, with solid workstation growth in banking and increased demand for our portfolio analytics solutions, as market conditions continue to evolve, our subscription-based ASV will continue to support value-based pricing.\nGAAP revenue increased by 9% to $425 million, while organic revenue, which excludes any impact from foreign exchange and acquisitions, increased 9% to $423 million, with growth primarily driven by analytics, trading, and research and advisory services.\nAll regions experienced significant year-over-year growth.\nFor our geographic segments, on an organic basis, Americas revenue grew 9%, EMEA also grew 9%, and Asia Pacific revenues increased by 14%.\nThe main drivers in the region were analytics, CTS, and workstation growth.\nLet's now discuss expenditures.\nIn Q1, GAAP operating costs increased by 13% to $302 million, affected by expected changes during this time frame.\nWe implemented a $9 million restructuring charge to create a more streamlined and empowered organizational structure.\nThe ongoing benefits from this reorganization will mainly be used to reinvest in products and retain key employees.\nWe also recorded $4 million in expenses related to vacating certain office space in NYC.\nWe recently surveyed our employees about preferred work arrangements, and in line with market trends, a large majority favor hybrid or remote work models.\nBased on this preference, we're reevaluating our real estate requirements to align with new work arrangements.\nDuring Q1, we established the FactSet Charitable Foundation to support our corporate social responsibility initiatives.\nOur GAAP operating margin decreased by 230 basis points to 29% year-over-year, while our adjusted operating margin fell by 70 basis points to 34%.\nAs previously mentioned, this surpasses our guidance for this metric.\nThe rise in expenses was somewhat mitigated by reduced compensation costs.\nOur cost of sales as a percentage of revenue was 32 basis points higher than last year on a GAAP basis, but 72 basis points lower on an adjusted basis.\nThis reflects higher data and infrastructure costs, as well as increased compensation for our current workforce.\nThese expenses also include our ongoing migration to the public cloud, part of our digital transformation and multi-year investment strategy.\nLower personnel costs partially offset these increases.\nSG&A expenses, when expressed as a percentage of revenue, were 198 basis points higher year-over-year on a GAAP basis and 145 basis points higher on an adjusted basis.\nThe main factors include higher employee compensation, increased bonus accrual, and real estate exit costs.\nThis was partially counterbalanced by lower stock compensation compared to the previous year.\nRegarding taxes, our quarterly tax rate was 10%, down from 16% last year.\nThis lower rate resulted from a tax benefit due to stock option exercises, prompted by our record stock price.\nThis led to a higher-than-expected annual estimated benefit.\nThe reduced annual rate was partially offset by higher-than-anticipated U.S. income.\nGAAP earnings per share rose 7% to $2.79 this quarter, compared to $2.62 in the prior year.\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share increased by 13% to $3.25, driven by higher revenues and a lower tax rate.\nFree cash flow, defined as cash generated from operations minus capital spending, was $64 million for the quarter, a 9% decrease from the same period last year.\nThis was mainly due to the timing of tax payments, higher year-over-year employee bonus payments, and reduced capital expenditures related to facilities improvements.\nOur ASV retention remained above 95%.\nWe increased our total number of clients by 14% compared to the previous year, primarily due to the addition of more wealth and corporate clients.\nOur client retention improved to 92% year-over-year, demonstrating the success of our products, investments, and sales team efforts.\nIn Q1, we bought back 46,200 shares of our common stock for a total of $19 million at an average price of $403 per share.\nWe maintain a disciplined approach to our buyback program and are committed to delivering long-term value to our shareholders.\nWe are reaffirming our 2022 guidance, and as we often state, our business performance is typically split between two halves of the year.\nAlthough it's evident that our momentum from Q4 has continued and we believe we're well-positioned to meet our targets, it's still early in the fiscal year.\nWe remain committed to developing our content, technology, and people, as well as delivering value for our shareholders.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:To begin, our Chief Executive Officer, Bryan Jordan, and Chief Financial Officer, BJ Losch, will provide an overview of our results before opening the floor for questions.\nWe are delighted to have our Chief Credit Officer, Susan Springfield, joining us to assist with this process.\nOur current statements reflect our present views and we are not obligated to provide future updates.\nI will now turn the floor over to Bryan.\nThis quarter has been highly significant for our organization.\nWe finalized our merger of equals with IBERIABANK and acquired 30 branches from SunTrust Truist, which is an exciting development.\nThe integration of these branches was completed in mid-July.\nWe've made considerable advancements during this quarter.\nWe are very satisfied with the organization's performance and the outstanding efforts of our employees in serving their customers and communities during these challenging times.\nOur business is showing positive momentum, and we've once again demonstrated the counter-cyclical benefits of our operations in mortgage, mortgage warehouse lending, and fixed income.\nOur balance sheet continues to exhibit strong performance.\nOver the past decade or so, we have significantly restructured our balance sheet, with a greater emphasis on Commercial and Industrial lending.\nWe experienced net charge-offs of 44 basis points this quarter and observed a slight increase in nonperforming assets, but we concluded the period with approximately $1.3 billion in loss-taking capacity.\nWe had a successful quarter in terms of deposit activity.\nWe saw favorable customer inflows and the balance sheet appears healthy, with some progress made in adjusting our pricing to offset the lower interest rate environment.\nDuring the quarter, we also made significant progress on our expenses.\nWe achieved an additional $8 million in run rate savings towards our goal of $170 million plus in expense reductions.\nWe are confident in our progress in managing costs and planning for the integration.\nThe investor deck includes informative slides detailing expectations for expense efficiencies in the coming quarters and year.\nOur capital foundation remains robust.\nWe are very pleased with our positioning.\nOur Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio was 9.15%.\nThe dilution of our tangible book value due to the branch acquisition and merger completion was minimal, largely counterbalanced by our quarterly earnings.\nOur integration planning continues to progress well, with major integration work expected to be completed by early fall 2021.\nWe are on schedule for completing this integration.\nThere is considerable work to be done between now and then.\nEmployees across the organization are working to ensure a seamless transition, minimizing any negative impact on our customers and communities.\nThe progress of the PPP programs and fiscal stimulus has been positive for the economy so far, but uncertainty remains.\nWe believe we are well-positioned with a strong balance sheet, robust loss-taking capacity, and solid capital, as well as benefiting from our counter-cyclical businesses and the potential for significant cost savings over the next 18 to 24 months.\nI will conclude my remarks here.\nIt's crucial to note that the impact of merger accounting on our financials aligns with the estimates we provided during the second quarter call and in the pro forma released during the quarter.\nWe have included detailed information on the marks and other merger-related impacts in the appendix for your review.\nSlide 6 presents a summary of our adjusted financials for the quarter compared to FHN stand-alone adjusted results from previous quarters.\nThe trends here primarily reflect the net impact of the IBERIA merger and the branch acquisition.\nMoving to Slide 7, we'll examine net interest income and net interest margin.\nWe generated net interest income of $532 million this quarter, an increase of $227 million from the previous quarter, primarily due to the merger.\nNet interest income remained relatively stable compared to the second quarter's combined levels, despite the challenging interest rate environment.\nThe third quarter results included a $44 million advantage from accretion, equating to roughly 12 basis points on the NIM, which was slightly higher than initially anticipated due to increased prepayments.\nThe reported NIM decreased by 6 basis points to 2.84% in the quarter, reflecting the effects of low rates and high liquidity levels, partially counterbalanced by accretion.\nWe are continuously working to enhance our deposit pricing structure.\nThis quarter saw another reduction in our deposit rate, with interest-bearing deposit expenses dropping to 36 basis points.\nWe aim to reduce interest-bearing deposit costs to levels similar to those seen during the previous zero interest rate period in 2015, around 24 basis points.\nWe intend to standardize our deposit pricing across the expanded franchise in the current quarter, which should yield additional benefits as we enter 2021.\nOur NIM continues to be affected by significantly higher liquidity levels.\nWe estimate that excess cash reduced the third quarter margin by approximately 12 basis points.\nOur average excess cash was about $3 billion, increasing to $4.5 billion by the end of the quarter.\nAlthough this excess cash position lowers the margin, it does not affect our net interest income.\nWe are actively seeking more attractive reinvestment options for the future and expect to utilize more of that money over time.\nWe anticipate further margin pressure in the fourth quarter, likely in the high single-digit to low double-digit range, but expect this to be the lowest point for NIM going forward.\nOn Slides 8 and 9, we've presented our results compared to the combined previous period results for FHN and IBERIA.\nWe achieved strong performance in fee income again in the third quarter, with relatively stable results compared to the previous quarter and a 23% year-over-year increase, as our counter-cyclical businesses in fixed income and mortgage banking helped offset COVID-related pressure in some of our more traditional banking fee income streams.\nFixed income results met expectations, remaining relatively stable compared to the previous quarter and showing a $33 million increase year-over-year, with average daily revenues of $1.5 million.\nMortgage banking once again delivered outstanding results, with a $13 million increase from the previous quarter and almost $40 million year-over-year.\nSecondary originations of $1.2 billion were up 3% from strong second quarter levels, while gain on sale margins expanded over 100 basis points to 3.93%.\nLooking ahead to the fourth quarter, we anticipate a seasonal slowdown in volumes for both of these businesses, but expect overall market conditions to remain favorable for the foreseeable future.\nAs shown on Slide 9, we continue to maintain our commitment to expense discipline.\nExpenses decreased by $15 million compared to the previous quarter, as reductions in personnel and other non-interest expenses were partially offset by an expected increase in intangibles amortization from the Merger and Branch acquisition.\nSalaries and benefits increased by $7 million, driven by the alignment of benefits across the combined platform, the addition of personnel from the 30 acquired branches, and an increase in healthcare costs following the pandemic-driven slowdown.\nThis increase was more than offset by a reduction in revenue-based incentives and commissions, as well as lower deferred comp costs.\nOur results this quarter also reflect the benefit of $8 million in net merger cost savings, bringing our year-to-date total to $18 million.\nWe recognize the importance of maintaining a strong focus on cost control as a lever in this environment.\nWe have unique advantages to do so given our merger and will continue to seek further expense reductions beyond our targeted merger savings.\nSlides 13 and 14 provide a review of our loan growth and funding profiles relative to combined First Horizon and IBERIA results.\nAs anticipated, period-end loan growth was modest due to subdued customer demand, ongoing payoffs, and utilization rates returning to more normal levels.\nA highlight of the quarter was the continued strong mortgage warehouse demand, which led to a $1.6 billion increase in loans to mortgage companies on a spot basis and approximately $430 million on average.\nSimilar to fixed income and mortgage banking originations, loans to mortgage companies serve as a counter-cyclical, high-return specialty business for us, and we expect continued strong performance.\nOn the liability side, period-end deposits increased by $2.3 billion, primarily driven by the branch acquisition and continued strong customer inflows, allowing us to reduce higher-cost non-customer balances.\nGiven current levels of excess liquidity and our enhanced market presence, we expect to further lower our interest-bearing deposit costs, particularly as we move to align our pricing strategies across the footprint.\nWe also improved our funding profile with a $1.2 billion reduction in borrowings from 2Q combined levels, leveraging our excess liquidity to pay down legacy IBERIA Federal Home Loan Bank advances.\nTurning to Slide 12, we'll cover asset quality over the next few slides.\nOur results this quarter clearly reflect the impact of the merger, with many moving parts.\nHowever, broadly speaking, overall asset quality remains relatively stable outside of energy, despite the impacts of COVID-19.\nNet charge-offs increased to 44 basis points, up from 20 basis points for legacy FHN, driven by energy-related losses.\nWe saw a relatively modest 6 basis point increase in NPLs to 75 basis points of total loans, despite the impact of the merger.\nSlide 13 shows that we continued to add reserves this quarter, with the merger and branch acquisition adding $475 million to the allowance for credit losses.\nBeyond merger-related changes, we also increased reserves by a modest $13 million.\nWe concluded the quarter with $1.1 billion in reserves, equal to 2.15% of the loan portfolio, excluding low-risk PPP and mortgage company loans, and roughly four times annualized net charge-offs.\nIncluding the unrecognized discount on acquired loans, our total loss absorbing capacity reaches $1.3 billion or over 2% of total loans.\nSlide 14 provides an updated perspective on portfolios most impacted by the pandemic, as identified by investors.\nWe conducted thorough reviews of $9 billion in commercial loans across various sectors affected by the current situation.\nBased on these assessments and broader portfolio evaluations, we estimate that just under 11% of our total loans require heightened monitoring.\nWe've highlighted potentially stressed sub-sectors such as real estate lending, energy, retail, trade, and non-fast food accommodation and foodservice.\nIt's worth noting that sectors like essential services, recreational goods, manufacturing, and home improvement continue to perform well, as does our high-quality consumer portfolio with an average refreshed FICO score of 750.\nSo far, customers have shown more resilience than initially anticipated, and overall stress appears to be decreasing.\nThe appendix contains information on reserve coverage across our portfolio and deferrals, which have significantly decreased to about 2.4% of federal loan balances from a peak of nearly 13%.\nWe remain confident in our risk profile and reserve levels, especially after thoroughly marking the IBERIA loan book, which comprises about 45% of the portfolio.\nRegarding capital and tangible book value per share on Slide 15, TBV per share remained relatively stable at $9.92 compared to the second quarter, with strong earnings offset by the IBERIA merger, Truist branch acquisition impacts, and the CET1 ratio ending at 9.15%.\nIn the short term, we aim to maintain a CET1 ratio between 9% and 9.25%.\nSlide 16 provides a Merger Integration Update, highlighting our continued enthusiasm for the opportunities arising from our merger of equals.\nWe've established a robust integration framework to capitalize on these opportunities efficiently, despite the pandemic.\nSignificant progress has been made in aligning cultures, processes, and systems for successful integration.\nMuch of the HR-related integration is complete, including leadership identification and payroll system conversion.\nOn the customer side, we've developed go-to-market and organizational models, and finalized our customer experience dashboard.\nWe're on schedule to convert various platforms and plan for full systems conversion in fall 2021.\nThird quarter cost savings totaled $8 million, bringing the year-to-date total to $18 million.\nWe've provided an updated view of expected savings over time and remain confident in delivering at least $170 million of annualized savings in 2022, with a slight shift in the savings timeline.\nThe table on the right shows estimated timing of merger savings on an annualized basis.\nOur third quarter 2020 annualized expense base, excluding incentives and commissions, was about $1.52 billion, and we expect a low single-digit decrease in 2021 expenses based on merger savings timing.\nSlide 17 summarizes our position to leverage our diversified business model across attractive southern markets, with a revenue mix offsetting NII pressure from low rates.\nWe benefit from merger cost savings and have demonstrated commitment to expense control through prior acquisitions and efficiency initiatives.\nOur risk management approach should help mitigate credit losses, supported by the marked loan book and significant loss absorption capacity.\nWhile economic challenges persist and loan demand is needed, we can focus on merger integration for the next year, expecting our business model to drive outperformance and shareholder value creation.\nI want to acknowledge the extraordinary efforts of our teams across various departments in navigating this complex and unique quarter and year.\nOur strong balance sheet, capital, and liquidity position us well in this challenging environment.\nWe've maintained robust underwriting standards and built a diversified portfolio focused on downturn performance and profitability.\nDespite economic headwinds, we're uniquely positioned to capitalize on merger opportunities, enhancing scale, efficiency, and earning power to create significant shareholder value.\nWe remain committed to supporting our associates, communities, and customers in overcoming COVID-19 impacts and revitalizing the economy.\nWe're well-positioned and excited about the combination of IBERIABANK and First Horizon, with unprecedented opportunities ahead.\nSummary: ",

the Company.\nJoining me on today's call is Jennifer Sherman, who holds the positions of President and Chief Executive Officer.\nThese materials can be accessed on our company's website.\nWe will be submitting our Form 10-Q later today as well.\nI'll start by providing a detailed overview of our first quarter performance, then hand it over to Jennifer to discuss current market conditions, our progress on strategic initiatives, and our outlook for the rest of the year.\nWe had another excellent quarter with record-breaking orders and operational results, surpassing our expectations despite ongoing challenges related to the pandemic.\nWe also had to contend with the February ice storms in the southern states, which forced us to temporarily shut down our facilities in Texas, Alabama, and Mississippi.\nLuckily, we didn't suffer any major damage, but we did lose several days of production.\nDespite these obstacles, our teams bounced back well, with both divisions achieving adjusted EBITDA margins that matched or exceeded those from the first quarter of last year.\nThis achievement is particularly noteworthy given the strength of the previous year's quarter, which saw record production at our largest facility and minimal impact from the pandemic.\nLooking at the figures, our consolidated net sales for the quarter were $279 million, compared to $286 million in the same period last year.\nThe consolidated operating income for the quarter was $27.8 million, down from $32.3 million in the previous year.\nOur consolidated adjusted EBITDA for the quarter stood at $41.2 million, compared to $43.9 million in the same quarter last year.\nThis translates to a margin of 14.8% in Q1 this year, slightly down from 15.3% last year.\nThe net income for the quarter was $22.2 million, a slight decrease from $23.4 million in the same period last year.\nThis equates to GAAP earnings of $0.36 per share for the quarter, compared to $0.38 per share in the previous year.\nAfter adjustments, our earnings per share for the quarter were $0.38, slightly down from $0.39 per share in the same quarter last year.\nWe saw exceptional order intake this quarter, with orders totaling $384 million, setting a new quarterly record and representing an increase of $80 million or 26% compared to Q1 of last year.\nOur consolidated backlog at the quarter's end also set a new company record at $410 million, which is $9 million higher than Q1 last year and $106 million or 35% more than at the end of 2020.\nRegarding our group performance, ESG's net sales for the quarter were $228 million, slightly down from $233 million last year.\nESG's operating income for the quarter was $27.1 million, a decrease from $29.4 million in the previous year.\nThe adjusted EBITDA for ESG this quarter was $39.3 million, compared to $40 million in the same period last year.\nThis translates to an adjusted EBITDA margin of 17.2%, which is consistent with last year's figure.\nESG reported orders of $324 million in Q1 this year, a significant improvement of $87 million or 37% compared to the previous year.\nSSG's net sales for the quarter were $51 million, slightly lower than the $53 million recorded last year.\nThe operating income for the quarter was $7.2 million, a slight decrease from $7.4 million in the previous year.\nSSG's adjusted EBITDA for the quarter remained steady at around $8.2 million, while its adjusted EBITDA margin improved to 16.2%, an increase of 80 basis points from Q1 last year.\nSSG's orders for the quarter totaled $60 million, down from $66 million in the same period last year.\nCorporate operating expenses for the quarter increased to $6.5 million from $4.5 million last year.\nThis increase was mainly due to an unfavorable year-over-year variance of $2.6 million related to changes in mark-to-market adjustments of post-retirement reserves.\nThese market-based adjustments positively impacted our earnings by about $0.02 per share in Q1 last year but had a negative effect in Q1 this year.\nExamining the consolidated income statement, the decrease in sales led to a $6 million reduction in gross profit.\nThe consolidated gross margin for the quarter was 24.7%, down from 26.1% in the previous year.\nAs a percentage of sales, our selling, engineering, general and administrative expenses for the quarter decreased by 20 basis points compared to Q1 last year, despite the unfavorable mark-to-market variance mentioned earlier.\nOther factors influencing the quarterly results include a $700,000 increase in other income and a $400,000 decrease in interest expense.\nTax expense for the quarter decreased by $2.2 million, primarily due to lower pre-tax income levels and higher excess tax benefits from stock compensation activity.\nOur effective tax rate for the quarter was 18.4%, down from 23.5% last year.\nThe lower tax rate in Q1 of this year aligned with our expectations, as we had factored in an estimate of excess tax benefits.\nAt present, we still anticipate our full-year effective tax rate to be approximately 24%.\nOverall, on a GAAP basis, we earned $0.36 per share in Q1 this year, compared to $0.38 per share in Q1 last year.\nTo enable more accurate earnings comparisons, we typically adjust our GAAP earnings per share to exclude unusual items recorded in the current or prior year quarters.\nFor this quarter, we made adjustments to GAAP earnings per share to exclude acquisition-related expenses, coronavirus-related expenses, and purchase accounting expense effects.\nAfter these adjustments, our earnings for the quarter were $0.38 per share, compared to $0.39 per share in the same period last year.\nRegarding cash flow, we generated $26 million from operations during the quarter, a $21 million improvement over Q1 last year.\nWe concluded the quarter with $168 million of net debt and $270 million available under our credit facility.\nOur current net debt leverage ratio remains low, even after funding the acquisition of OSW during the quarter for approximately $53 million.\nOur robust financial status enables us to invest in organic growth and pursue strategic acquisitions such as OSW.\nWe remain dedicated to seeking strategic acquisitions and returning value to shareholders through dividends and opportunistic share buybacks.\nDuring the quarter, we distributed $5.5 million in dividends, reflecting an increased payout of $0.09 per share.\nWe have recently announced a comparable dividend for the second quarter.\nIt has been more than a year since the onset of the pandemic.\nDespite numerous challenges, I continue to be impressed by our teams' adaptability in modifying work practices for employee safety, managing uncertain market conditions, and innovating to serve customers.\nWhile some COVID-related disruptions persist, the situation is gradually improving.\nOur company-wide efforts to promote vaccine awareness, facilitate employee access to vaccines, and encourage participation are yielding positive results, with our domestic employee vaccination rates exceeding the national average.\nIn Illinois, where we have three major facilities and the corporate office, over 60% of our employees have completed their vaccination.\nWe've observed an increase in our sales resources traveling, reinforcing our customer-focused value proposition and contributing to higher order intake.\nAs in the previous two quarters, we experienced increased demand for our products, with first-quarter order intake setting a new company record, surpassing the previous high by more than $50 million.\nOur first quarter orders indicate strength across most of our end markets and growing confidence in a post-pandemic recovery, further bolstered by recent economic stimulus.\nThis sentiment appears to be widely shared by our dealer partners and customers across most of our businesses.\nDemand for sewer cleaners remains robust, with first quarter orders up 30% year-over-year, and nearly double the amount recorded in the previous quarter.\nSafe digging continues to gain acceptance in the market.\nIn recent years, approximately 70% of our sewer cleaner orders have included an optional safe-digging package, allowing the equipment to be used for hydro or vacuum excavation purposes.\nWe observed similar trends this quarter, with customer appreciation for the safety and efficiency benefits of safe digging gaining momentum.\nAt MRL, our road marking and line removal business, first quarter orders reached the highest quarterly levels since we acquired the business in 2019.\nWith its planned expansion now complete, we are well-positioned to benefit from potential infrastructure investment.\nOur road marking services business, Highmark, also secured an $8 million striping contract during the quarter.\nSince the fourth quarter of last year, we've noticed an uptick in our industrial end markets, with improved orders for our Guzzler and JetStream products as we approach the spring-cleaning season.\nAdditionally, our dump bodies and trailer businesses reported strong organic order growth of 28% across our end markets, achieving record backlog.\nWhile our backlog is at an all-time high, several factors may limit our ability to fully realize the benefits of the operating leverage we typically experience with backlog at these levels.\nThe first factor, which many of you may be aware of, is the impact of the global semiconductor shortage on chassis availability.\nWe began noticing supply tightness late last year, and our teams proactively secured additional chassis and advised our customers and dealer partners to do the same for orders where they supply the chassis.\nAs a reminder, customers supply the chassis about 50% of the time for our ESG businesses, excluding TBEI, where the customer almost always provides the chassis.\nWe were recently informed by one of our chassis suppliers that they are temporarily halting production of certain chassis for up to 90 days due to the semiconductor shortage.\nThis issue primarily affects our sewer cleaners, safe digging trucks, and certain street sweeper models.\nThe situation remains fluid, and our teams have been working diligently to mitigate the impact of this short-term disruption.\nBased on the information we've received, we expect the situation to be resolved during the third quarter, with production expected to ramp up quickly thereafter.\nBecause we don't rely on a single TSC manufacturer, and due to our proactive measures, we've been able to adapt quickly to minimize the financial impact.\nFor example, at Elgin, our team adjusted production schedules to build a higher concentration of three-wheel Pelican sweepers during the expected impact period.\nAs a reminder, we manufacture the chassis ourselves for that product line.\nAt our Streator facility, where we produce sewer cleaners and safe digging trucks, we've been working to secure additional chassis from other manufacturers.\nHowever, due to lead times on certain chassis, there will be a period of approximately two weeks where we face a shortage at Vactor.\nTo optimize efficiency, our teams have carefully managed the schedule so that this brief pause will coincide with the July 4 holiday.\nWith the additional chassis supply we've secured, we anticipate a production ramp-up thereafter.\nLike many companies, we are also experiencing rising commodity costs.\nAs our teams have done in the past, we took proactive measures such as locking in pricing and securing steel availability based on forecasted needs.\nOur teams are working diligently to mitigate the impacts of rising commodity costs by implementing price increases and surcharges where possible.\nRegarding labor availability, our ongoing commitment to environmental, social, and governance principles continues to benefit our company.\nInvestment in our employees sets us apart and enhances our ability to attract labor at the majority of our facilities.\nI'd like to take a few moments to provide an update on our strategic growth initiatives.\nWe remain optimistic about the prospects for safe digging, and with the observed recovery in industrial end markets and infrastructure spending optimism throughout the channel, we are confident that safe digging trends will continue to improve.\nOur TRUVAC safe digging product line portfolio includes a comprehensive range of truck-mounted safe digging equipment with applications across various end markets.\nWe were pleased to see that TRUVAC product demonstrations for the quarter increased by 70% compared to last year.\nEducation initiatives are positively influencing demand for sewer cleaners, with the optional safe digging package transforming them into versatile vehicles.\nAftermarket revenue has shown improvement, increasing by 6% and comprising a larger portion of ESG's quarterly earnings at approximately 27%.\nWe are vigilantly monitoring rental fleet usage and exercising caution in decisions regarding the fleet's size and composition.\nRecently, we've observed robust sales of used equipment and an increase in rentals.\nWe're keeping a close eye on the COVID-19 situation in Canada, where Ontario and other provinces are implementing some of the strictest stay-at-home measures since the pandemic began.\nAlthough we haven't experienced significant financial impacts yet, our Canadian markets may be affected in the coming months, which is typically a strong season for equipment rentals and parts sales.\nWe have several new product launches planned for organic growth, and I'll discuss a few of them today.\nStreet sweeper electrification remains a key focus for investment within ESG.\nWe've previously discussed our initial orders for the hybrid electric broom bear street sweeper, expected to be shipped later this year.\nThis hybrid model utilizes both battery power and either CNG or diesel for sweeping, designed to match or surpass current sweeper performance.\nOur dealer network is currently demonstrating the hybrid broom bear, starting on the West Coast and moving to the Southeast, with positive feedback so far.\nWe're also developing a hybrid version of our most popular street sweeper, the Pelican.\nThe plug-in hybrid electric Pelican sweeper is assembled and undergoing testing, with product demonstrations scheduled for the latter half of this year.\nWe're seeing benefits from new product introductions in our dump body and trailer product line.\nProducts launched in the past year contributed to about 4% organic growth this quarter.\nIn SSG, our innovation pipeline typically includes numerous new product introductions and enhancements that, while individually may not have a significant financial impact, collectively contribute to meaningful organic growth.\nWe began production of our MicroPulse line this quarter, a low-profile, high-performance LED lighting product for first responders and work truck vehicles.\nThis line includes both new product models and previously outsourced ones.\nIn-sourcing this line, which uses automated laser technology, is expected to improve related margins and generate annual savings exceeding $1 million.\nWe're on track to launch a low-cost light power in the second quarter.\nIn addition to organic growth initiatives, M&A will continue to play a significant role in our future growth.\nWe acquired OSW, a leading dump body manufacturer and truck equipment and trailer upfitter, during the quarter.\nThis acquisition presents substantial opportunities for long-term value creation through the application of our 80/20 improvement principle, organic growth initiatives, and additional bolt-on acquisitions.\nWe recently held an initial 80/20 improvement training session at OSW, which was well-received by the teams.\nIntegration is progressing well, and although it's early, OSW had a strong start in the first quarter.\nOur M&A pipeline has been very active, and it's been exciting to visit potential targets in person again.\nAs Ian mentioned, our strong financial position and liquidity allow us to pursue strategic acquisitions, and our teams are currently reviewing several M&A opportunities.\nWe've continued to make significant investments in our existing facilities to increase capacity for long-term growth and improve operational efficiency through automation.\nAs we optimize our manufacturing footprint, we're evaluating our long-term strategy for our Elgin and University Park production facilities in Illinois.\nBoth properties are currently leased at above-market rates with leases ending in 2023.\nWe're exploring opportunities and alternative facilities in the surrounding areas as we proactively plan for a potential relocation.\nThe American Rescue Plan, a COVID relief package, includes approximately $1.9 trillion in economic stimulus, with about $350 billion allocated to state, local, and territorial governments to maintain frontline workers, distribute vaccines, increase testing, reopen schools, and sustain essential services.\nWe're actively educating our dealer network about the stimulus program and have shared the latest estimated allocation of the $350 billion in state and local government support by jurisdiction with our dealers to pass on to their customers.\nAs a provider of equipment used for essential services like sewer cleaning and street sweeping, Federal Signal is well-positioned to benefit significantly from additional aid that may be provided to state and local sources for these purposes.\nOur first-quarter order intake showed that our dealer partners remain optimistic about market conditions in 2021, noting that both corporate and sales tax collections have held up better than initially expected, which should provide stability to their revenue sources.\nWe anticipate that a long-term infrastructure bill will provide visibility for project planning and could lead to increased capital equipment demand in areas such as roads, bridges, broadband, clean energy, and public transportation development.\nWe expect this to benefit the majority of our product offerings, including equipment sales and rentals of dump trucks and trailers, safe digging trucks, road marking equipment, sewer cleaners, and street sweepers.\nWe have positioned Federal Signal to fully participate in the post-pandemic recovery by increasing capacity within our facilities, reducing lead times to better respond to customer needs, investing in new product development, and gaining market share.\nRegarding our outlook for the rest of the year, orders so far have exceeded our expectations, driven by new product launches, ongoing execution of our strategic initiatives, and strong recovery in our end markets.\nWe're currently facing some short-term production challenges at our largest facility due to temporary impacts on certain chassis manufacturers from the global semiconductor shortage.\nOur teams are working diligently to navigate this disruption, as they have in similar situations in the past.\nAfter considering the expected impact over the next couple of months, we're maintaining our adjusted earnings per share outlook for the year at $1.73 to $1.85.\nWith our recently completed capacity expansion at several facilities, we're well-positioned once the current chassis uncertainty subsides.\nDemand for our products is at an all-time high, with the recent federal stimulus and potential infrastructure investment offering further momentum, which we haven't factored into our current outlook.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Details required by SEC Regulation G for these non-GAAP financial measures can be found in the Investors area of our website, www.fortive.com, under the Investors Quarterly Results section.\nWe finalized the division of our Industrial Technologies segment by spinning off Vontier Corporation on October 9, 2020, and have consequently included the Industrial Technologies segment's results as discontinued operations.\nAll mentions of year-over-year increases or decreases and financial metrics pertain to continuing operations.\nLet's begin with slide three.\nOur Q1 performance continued to showcase the advantages of our efforts to improve our portfolio's growth and resilience, substantially expanding our presence in software and healthcare while adding significant sources of higher-growth recurring revenue.\nConsequently, our portfolio has been well-positioned to drive rapid sequential improvement in recent quarters as markets have started to reopen.\nIn the first quarter, we continued to observe significant improvement, not only in our short-cycle businesses, mainly Fluke Instruments and Tektronix, but also in many businesses that have faced COVID-related challenges, such as Advanced Sterilization Products.\nNow, let's look at the quarter's results.\nWe achieved total revenue growth of 13.6% and core revenue growth of 9.1%, surpassing the upper end of our guidance.\nAdjusted earnings per share reached $0.63, representing a 37% year-over-year increase.\nThe combined outperformance in core growth and earnings contributed to another strong quarter of free cash flow.\nOur SaaS offerings at Accruent, Intelex, Censis, eMaint, and Gordian continued to perform well, generating double-digit growth in the quarter, with Gordian experiencing better overall top-line momentum.\nThese software offerings play a crucial role in our strategy to leverage leading hardware positions to provide broader software-enabled solutions that address pain points in our customers' critical workflows and their ongoing digital transformation priorities.\nDespite the challenges posed by the COVID environment, we continued to use FBS tools to drive performance improvements across our portfolio.\nASP is expanding the implementation of the Fortive Business System more broadly, driving strong improvements in working capital turns and progress in accelerating commercial efforts, delivering its fifth consecutive quarter of growth in its global installed base.\nIntelex also continues to benefit from the application of FBS tools to enhance its sales process, leading to better lead generation, improved customer win rates, and stronger sales pipeline creation.\nWhile these are just a couple of examples, we are highly focused on building FBS capability across our newer businesses to deliver accelerated growth, innovation, and market share gains.\nRegarding organic growth, we continue to invest in strategic initiatives across our operating companies and build additional capacity to drive future innovation.\nWith the FORT, we are scaling our data analytics capabilities, providing leverage to our operating companies to pursue key AI and machine learning applications.\nIn 2020, we more than doubled the number of projects conducted and expect to do the same this year, targeting over $250 million in potential revenue opportunities.\nOur acquisition of ehsAI significantly expanded our machine learning expertise to help grow our position within EHS workflows and generate learnings that can be applied more broadly within Fortive.\nWe've also made several additional investments to expand our partnership with Pioneer Square Labs, with three startup opportunities currently in different phases of incubation.\nThese investments enhance our ability to generate disruptive innovation that will deepen our competitive advantage and increase our customer value proposition.\nRegarding performance across major geographies, core growth was led by low 20% growth in Asia.\nThis included approximately 30% growth in China and low double-digit growth in Japan.\nElsewhere, our core revenue grew by low double-digits in Western Europe and by low single-digits in North America.\nTaking a closer look at segment performance on slide seven, Intelligent Operating Solutions posted a total revenue increase of 9.5%, with core revenue increase of 5.5%.\nThis included high-teens growth in China, high single-digit growth in Western Europe, and flat top-line performance in North America.\nFluke's core revenue continued to improve in the first quarter, increasing by high single-digits.\nThis performance was highlighted by low double-digit growth at Fluke Industrial and high-teens growth at Fluke Calibration.\nFluke's growth included the launch of the 377 and 378 Fluke Connect plant meters for non-contact voltage testing.\nThese introductions incorporate Fluke's FieldSense technology and extend its leadership position in safer non-contact measurement tools.\nAt Fluke Industrial, point-of-sale in North America turned positive in the first quarter, increasing by low single digits.\nMeanwhile, point-of-sale in both Western Europe and China continued to improve, rising by mid-single digits and mid-teens, respectively.\nStrong performance at Fluke Digital Systems continued this quarter, increasing by mid-single digits as eMaint saw strong demand with mid-teens growth in SaaS bookings.\nIndustrial Scientific declined single-digits in the first quarter due to continued weakness in instrument sales.\nThe company's iNet offering continued to demonstrate its resilience, increasing by low single-digits.\niNet also registered an 18% increase in bookings while driving a more than 500 basis point improvement in net retention.\nISC's rental business saw strong bookings growth, signaling improving stability in its end-markets with customers beginning to restart maintenance project activity.\nSimultaneously, we're observing ongoing success from implementing FBS growth strategies at Intelex to boost sales pipeline generation, resulting in a record-breaking revenue quarter with growth in the low double digits.\nThe incorporation of ehsAI is progressing smoothly.\nAlthough its revenue contribution remains minimal, product integration is on track, and the Intelex team has begun to speed up new customer acquisition.\nAccruent experienced low single-digit growth in the first quarter, with SaaS growth standing out at high single digits.\nAccruent continues to experience positive momentum in its Industrial and Life Science divisions.\nThis included a recent contract with BioMarin, which incorporated Accruent's Meridian solution as a crucial tool for managing their pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities, facilitating communication with contractors and supporting FDA validation.\nAccruent is also witnessing increasing demand across various end markets for its facility planning and resource scheduling solutions as customers prepare their facilities for future workforce needs as they emerge from the pandemic.\nAccruent's growth in the quarter was boosted by the resumption of some on-site service, implementation, and project-related activities, with further improvements expected as the year progresses.\nFollowing challenges during the latter half of 2020, Gordian's top-line improved to break even in the first quarter.\nGordian's job order contracting procurement business grew by low single digits and is anticipated to accelerate as recovery from COVID continues to ramp up.\nThe company's estimating business continued to perform well, growing by high single-digits and experiencing strong renewal momentum and conversion rates for the SaaS version of its RSMeans product line.\nGordian observed signs of improvement regarding site access issues during the first quarter.\nWe anticipate this improvement will persist in the upcoming quarters.\nThe Precision Technology segment recorded a total revenue increase of 14.3% with a 12.1% rise in core revenue.\nThis included growth in the mid-30s percent in China, mid-teens in Western Europe, and mid single-digit in North America.\nTektronix generated high-teens growth, driven by strength in its general industrial and semiconductor markets.\nPoint-of-sale continued to accelerate, rising over 40% in China, over 20% in Western Europe, while North America turned positive with a mid single-digit increase in the quarter.\nTektronix has observed strong demand in China as economic recovery continues, driven by government investment in 5G, electric vehicles, and IoT solutions.\nExamining Tektronix's product lines, both mainstream oscilloscope and Keithley had an outstanding first quarter.\nMainstream oscilloscope posted high 30% growth, driven by strong demand trends across most of its key product segments, particularly our six series and four series scopes.\nKeithley grew mid-teens, while the Tektronix service business continued to show stability, reporting mid single-digit growth in the first quarter.\nTektronix also saw outperformance across a range of recent new product introductions, including its new ISO view probe solution for semiconductor and automotive market applications.\nSensing Technologies grew by low double-digits, driven by broad strengthening across end markets, including industrial and electronics customers.\nSensing witnessed accelerating demand in China as it secured a number of key wins with strong momentum among factory automation OEM customers.\nSensing also generated strong growth from its critical environment products, etc, with mid-30% growth for the quarter.\nPacific Scientific EMC returned to growth, increasing by low single-digits in the first quarter.\nThe business continued to see good order trends with a book-to-bill of 1.2 over the trailing 12 months and has a strong backlog that we expect to support improving growth in the coming quarters.\nShifting focus to Advanced Healthcare Solutions.\nTotal revenue increased 20.3% with a 10.9% increase in core revenue.\nThis included low 40% growth in China, low 20% growth in Western Europe and low single-digit growth in North America.\nASP returned to growth in the first quarter, increasing by mid single-digits.\nGrowth at ASP was driven by a greater than 40% increase in capital equipment sales as it continued to expand its global installed base.\nThis momentum in capital sales more than compensated for the fact that electric procedures were 91% of pre-COVID levels globally and continue to impact ASP's consumable revenue.\nStronger capital sales indicate the progress ASP is making in its FBS journey by improving sales execution and enhancing funnel management at priority independent delivery network accounts.\nASP continued to perform well in Western Europe, marking its fifth consecutive quarter of growth.\nASP was also recently designated as the Preferred Supplier by the National Health Service in the UK for a large multiyear tender for terminal sterilization capital and services.\nCensis also had a strong first quarter, growing by low-teens with low-double-digit growth in its CensiTrac SaaS offering.\nCensis has experienced improved upselling momentum across its business and is also seeing evidence of US hospitals transitioning to post-COVID operations and making faster purchasing decisions.\nFluke Health Solutions increased by low-teens in the first quarter, with broad strength across its product lines.\nFHS continues to successfully deploy FBS to drive growth and margin improvements at LANDAUER by leveraging global go-to-market scale and accelerating cross-selling of products and services.\nLandauer has seen its operating margins improve by approximately 2.5 times since being acquired.\nInvetech reported growth of around 45% as it fulfills a large backlog of diagnostic product orders from 2020.\nI will now hand over to Chuck, who will provide more information on our margins and free cash flow for the quarter.\nExcellent execution across all areas allowed us to achieve strong margin performance in the first quarter.\nIn Q1, adjusted gross margins increased by 90 basis points to 57%, driven by strong growth at Fluke and Tektronix, as well as improved gross margins at ASP after transitioning from service agreements.\nThis also reflected effective implementation of FBS throughout the company, including continued price realization of 90 basis points during the quarter.\nOur adjusted operating profit margin for Q1 was 22.7%, slightly higher than expected, partly due to stronger volume in the quarter.\nWe achieved 40% adjusted incremental operating margins, 240 basis points of core operating margin expansion, and over 200 basis points of core operating margin growth in each of our three segments.\nIn the first quarter, we generated $144 million in free cash flow, a 50% increase compared to the same period last year.\nWe are pleased with the consistent growth in free cash flow over the past year, with the first quarter bringing our trailing 12-month free cash flow to $950 million.\nAlong with significant earnings growth, disciplined working capital management at ASP, Fluke, and Tektronix contributed to this free cash flow performance.\nAt the beginning of Q1, we efficiently monetized our remaining 19.9% stake in Vontier, generating about $1.1 billion in proceeds, which we used to repay debt.\nBased on this transaction and our Q1 free cash flow, we ended the first quarter with a net leverage ratio of 1.2 times.\nOur strong free cash flow and significant balance sheet capacity position us well to pursue our key capital allocation priorities, and we are maintaining an active pipeline of potential deals.\nWe continue to see numerous opportunities to deploy capital to strengthen our core hardware and instrumentation positions while also leveraging our expertise to expand into adjacent high-value software and data-driven opportunities.\nLet's now look at the guidance on slide 11.\nDue to strong first quarter performance and an improved outlook for the rest of the year, we are raising our 2021 guidance.\nFor the full year, we now expect adjusted diluted net earnings per share to be between $2.50 and $2.60, representing 20% to 24% year-over-year growth on a continuing operations basis.\nThis projection assumes total revenue growth of 10% to 13%, core revenue growth of 7% to 10%, adjusted operating profit margins of 22% to 23%, and an effective tax rate of about 14%.\nIt also assumes core revenue growth of 5% to 7% in the second half of 2021.\nWe continue to expect free cash flow conversion to be approximately 105% of adjusted net income for the year.\nWe are introducing second quarter adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance of $0.56 to $0.60, representing 30% to 40% year-over-year growth.\nThis assumes total revenue growth of 20% to 23%, core revenue growth of 16% to 19%, adjusted operating profit margins of 19.5% to 20.5%, and an effective tax rate of about 14%.\nFor the second quarter, we expect free cash flow conversion to be approximately 85% of adjusted net income.\nThe full-year guidance includes $35 million of additional investments to drive innovation and enhance our capabilities for future growth, with $15 million allocated to the second quarter.\nThis includes funding for the FORT to expand our analytic capabilities and talent base, as well as to accelerate the development of AI and machine learning offerings for our customers.\nIt also includes funding for investments in our partnership with Pioneer Square Labs, where we have seen good early progress.\nI'll now hand it back to Jim for some closing remarks.\nBefore we move to questions on slide 13, I wanted to highlight our ongoing progress regarding key sustainability goals.\nIn Q1, we completed an updated materiality analysis, providing valuable insights that we used to define new pillars of our sustainability strategy, which will guide our future efforts.\nWe've made significant progress implementing the Intelex sustainability performance indicators platform across the portfolio, which we used to collect 2020 emissions data with new, more aggressive carbon emissions targets.\nWe look forward to discussing our progress and evolving sustainability goals at our upcoming Investor Day.\nToday's announced results demonstrate the depth and dedication of our teams and our relentless focus on continuous improvement principles that drive our culture.\nLooking ahead, we are excited about the strength of our portfolio, the quality of our market opportunities, and the significant organic and inorganic growth prospects before us.\nAs macro indicators continue to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, we will focus on driving strong core growth, margin expansion, and free cash flow generation, while investing in innovation and deploying capital for acquisitions that accelerate our strategy and increase customer value.\nWe're eager to share more details about our future plans at our Investor Day on May 19.\nIn the nearly five years since our spin-off, we have positioned our portfolio for higher growth, improved profitability, and stronger free cash flow generation.\nThis sets us up well for accelerated growth across our businesses, which we look forward to discussing with you.\nThat concludes our formal comments.\nSummary: ",

successfully completed the spin-off of Vontier Corporation, a global industrial technology company focused on mobility infrastructure, on October 9.\nI'm very proud of our team's dedication throughout the year leading up to the separation, and I'm excited about the future prospects for both companies.\nOur ability to remain prepared and execute this complex transaction despite the challenges posed by COVID-19 demonstrates our people's resilience and adaptability, as well as the strength of FBS.\nAs independent entities, both Fortive and Vontier are well-positioned to pursue their strategic objectives and create increasing value for all stakeholders.\nWith Vontier's spin-off complete, Fortive is well-positioned as a provider of crucial technologies for connected workflow solutions across various attractive markets.\nWe have strong market positions with leading brands that benefit from long-term growth trends and opportunities to increase recurring revenue.\nWe have a proven track record of disciplined capital allocation, significant financial capacity, strong free cash flow, and numerous opportunities for organic investment and strategic acquisitions across our portfolio.\nMost critically, we have the Fortive Business System, the foundation of our culture and a lasting competitive advantage that drives our commitment to continuous improvement.\nSince Vontier was part of Fortive during the third quarter, the financial results we'll discuss today include the Vontier businesses.\nThe guidance we provide today will only cover Fortive's continuing operations.\nLet's now examine the details of the quarter.\nAdjusted net earnings increased by 8.8% to $338.5 million compared to last year, with adjusted diluted net earnings per share at $0.94.\nTotal sales grew by 2.3% to $1.9 billion, with core revenue remaining essentially flat, showing significant sequential improvement from the previous quarter.\nAcquisitions contributed 220 basis points of growth, while favorable foreign currency exchange rates added 20 basis points to growth.\nThird quarter adjusted gross margins increased by 50 basis points year-over-year to 51.8%.\nGross margins benefited from a 50 basis point price increase, increased contribution from our higher-margin software businesses, and disciplined supply chain management.\nWe also achieved 160 basis points of core operating margin expansion, resulting in an adjusted operating profit margin of 22.7% for the quarter.\nOur ability to drive strong core operating margin expansion despite ongoing pandemic-related challenges reflected our teams' solid execution and disciplined application of FBS.\nWe continue to effectively manage the business through this uncertain environment, adjusting cost actions as needed while investing in our strategic product development and innovation priorities to position us well for the future.\nIn the third quarter, we generated $455 million of free cash flow, representing a conversion rate of 134% of adjusted net earnings and a 31% increase year-over-year.\nThis performance brought our year-to-date free cash flow to approximately $1.1 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of about 48%.\nDespite a challenging environment in recent quarters, our operating companies continue to use FBS to effectively manage their working capital in the short term, improving inventory turns and minimizing headwinds from the sequentially improving top line.\nLet's now look at our segments.\nProfessional Instrumentation reported a total revenue increase of 0.9% despite a 3.5% decline in core revenue.\nPurchases added 3.7 percentage points, while favorable currency exchange boosted growth by 0.7 percentage points.\nThe core operating margin rose by 0.9 percentage points, leading to an adjusted segment operating margin of 22.8%.\nIndustrial Technologies had a strong third quarter, particularly due to the performance of Gilbarco Veeder-Root and Matco in North America.\nOverall revenue grew by 4.5%, with core revenue increasing by 5.5%.\nThe core operating margin improved by 2.9 percentage points, resulting in a segment-level adjusted operating margin of 25.9%.\nThe growth rates presented in the slide reflect Fortive's consolidated Q3 growth, including the results from Vontier businesses.\nHowever, we will primarily discuss the operational details of the businesses remaining with Fortive.\nIn Asia, core revenue decreased slightly despite China experiencing mid-single-digit growth.\nChina's strength was widespread, with Fluke growing mid-teens year-over-year, Advanced Sterilization Products seeing double-digit growth, and Sensing expanding by over 20%.\nWestern Europe's core revenue declined by mid-single digits in Q3, with ASP showing low double-digit growth.\nASP has shown year-over-year growth in each quarter of 2020 so far, due to effective sales strategies.\nAccruent also performed well in Western Europe, led by its Meridian engineering information management solution, reflecting the company's growing momentum in the region.\nAlthough point-of-sale remained negative for both Fluke and Tektronix, the trend improved throughout the quarter, with revenue at these businesses increasing by mid-teens compared to the previous quarter.\nNorth America's core revenue grew slightly in Q3, showing broad-based sequential improvement compared to Q2.\nGrowth in North America was primarily driven by a strong performance from the Vontier businesses.\nWithin new Fortive, several software businesses continued to perform well, with growth seen in Intelex, eMaint, Censis, Industrial Scientific's iNet business, and Qualitrol.\nSimilar to Western Europe, Fluke and Tektronix saw improving point-of-sale trends, though still negative as we enter Q4.\nIn recent quarters, we have categorized our portfolio into groups based on their sensitivity to pandemic-related disruptions and resulting declines in end-market demand.\nAs depicted on Slide 11, the relative performance of these groups largely aligned with expectations for the quarter.\nGroup I, accounting for about 20% of new Fortive revenue in Q3, continued to demonstrate significant resilience, achieving low single-digit growth.\nThe group's performance was bolstered by strong contributions from software businesses, particularly Intelex, which saw high single-digit growth due to continued robust growth in North America and successful expansion into Western Europe.\nCensis achieved low single-digit growth, supported by the momentum of its SaaS offerings.\nAccruent benefited from the stability of its SaaS business, which saw a slight increase in the quarter with continued growth in annual recurring revenue due to improved retention and increased net retention.\nFluke Industrial Imaging had another strong quarter, though its growth slowed as some of the initial COVID-related demand began to stabilize.\nGordian experienced a slowdown in project work among state and local governments and higher education customers, resulting in a slight decline for the quarter.\nDespite continued strong order flow, EMC saw a mid-teens decline due to certain COVID-related supply chain issues and some customer delays.\nGroup II, representing about 32% of new Fortive revenue in Q3, experienced a slight decline.\nISC's iNet subscription business grew by high single digits, while Fluke Health Solutions achieved mid-single-digit growth driven by ventilator tester demand and support from Landauer's high recurring revenue business model.\nASP reported a mid-single-digit decline due to decreased performance in North America and pressure in Japan, which experienced a resurgence of COVID cases and a corresponding reduction in elective procedures.\nHowever, we are pleased to see this partially offset by strong growth in both China and Western Europe during the quarter.\nWe now estimate that elective procedures in the U.S. have returned to approximately 90% of pre-COVID levels, and to about 95% in both China and Europe.\nGroup III, accounting for about 12% of new Fortive in Q3, experienced a high single-digit decline in the quarter.\nThe Sensing portfolio experienced a decline in the mid-single digits, showing sequential improvement compared to the previous quarter.\nThe Sensing division saw positive results in semiconductors and electronics, as well as benefiting from COVID-related advantages in medical markets.\nIn Group III, Accruent's professional services and licenses segments continued to face negative impacts due to ongoing difficulties accessing customer locations.\nGroup IV, comprising about 36% of new Fortive Q3 revenue, saw a decrease in the high single digits but demonstrated significant sequential improvement, surpassing expectations.\nFluke Industrial and the Tektronix Instruments business both exhibited widespread sequential improvement.\nFluke Industrial experienced a slight decline in the low single digits, led by Fluke Calibration, which achieved mid-single-digit growth.\nKeithley, part of the Tek Instruments business, stood out by recording mid-single-digit year-over-year growth.\nThe business observed improved order activity as the quarter progressed, including initial orders for the new six and eight-channel versions of the six Series oscilloscope.\nAlthough encouraged by the performance of Fluke Industrial and the Tektronix Instruments business in Q3, we remain cautious about key macro trends as we work towards returning to year-over-year growth in both divisions.\nWe have continued to decrease our net debt since the end of Q2 using our strong free cash flow and the proceeds from the Vontier separation.\nOur net debt has been reduced to approximately $2.8 billion from over $5.1 billion at the end of 2019, including the recent proceeds from Vontier.\nWe anticipate generating solid free cash flow in the future, allowing us to further reduce our net debt.\nWe plan to monetize our remaining 19.9% stake in Vontier in a tax-efficient manner, with timing dependent on market conditions.\nWhile Q3 showed continued improvement in operating performance since the lifting of economic lockdowns in spring, we remain vigilant about macro conditions due to the ongoing fight against COVID-19.\nFor Q4, we project total revenue to increase between 0% and 3% year-over-year.\nWe expect to achieve incremental margins of about 35%.\nWe plan to implement approximately $30 million in strategic productivity initiatives before year-end, aligning with our previous expectation of making some temporary actions permanent as we enter 2021.\nThe resegmentation emphasizes our strong position in providing essential technologies for connected workflow solutions across various attractive markets.\nThis perspective helps frame our portfolio strategy for both organic and inorganic opportunities.\nThe Intelligent Operating Solutions segment includes Fluke, Industrial Scientific, Intelex, Accruent, and Gordian, representing about 40% of new Fortive total revenue and addressing a market exceeding $15 billion.\nThe Precision Technologies segment comprises Tektronix, Pacific Scientific EMC, Sensing businesses, and Qualitrol, representing approximately 35% of new Fortive total revenue and addressing a market over $10 billion.\nThe Advanced Health Care Solutions segment includes Advanced Sterilization Products, Fluke Health Solutions, Censis, and Invetech, representing about 25% of new Fortive total revenue and addressing a market exceeding $5 billion.\nWe will report based on this new segmentation from Q4 onward and plan to release supplemental financial information to help you adjust your models.\nI want to express gratitude to the Fortive and Vontier teams for their continued effort and strong execution in 2020 despite the challenging year.\nOur Q3 performance demonstrated how our team continues to meet challenges, completing Vontier spin-off preparations while navigating a difficult macro environment to deliver improved top-line performance and strong free cash flow.\nDespite near-term uncertainties, we will benefit from our increasingly resilient portfolio, established through efforts to transform it over the past four years.\nWith consistent free cash flow, a strong M&A pipeline, and expanding organic innovation capabilities, we are well-positioned to capitalize on future opportunities.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Jim Owens, President and CEO of H.B. Fuller, and John Corkrean, Executive VP and CFO, are our presenters today.\nWe'd like to remind you that our remarks today will include mentions of organic revenue, which doesn't account for currency exchange effects on our earnings or the impact of buying or selling businesses.\nWe think discussing these metrics is valuable for investors to help them understand our operational performance and how we stack up against other firms.\nUnless stated otherwise, when we talk about sales and revenue, we mean organic revenue, and when we discuss EPS, margins, or EBITDA, we're referring to adjusted non-GAAP figures.\nCOVID-19 and its effect on the global economy and business environment have intensified many of these risks and uncertainties.\nYesterday evening, we announced another quarter of robust revenue and profit growth.\nIn the second quarter, organic revenues grew by 19% compared to last year, adjusted EBITDA increased by 21%, and adjusted earnings per share rose by 38% to $0.94.\nWe successfully navigated significant supply chain challenges and swiftly increased prices during the quarter.\nWe achieved our highest-ever quarterly revenue as we met growing customer demand and expanded our market share.\nDuring the quarter, H.B. Fuller faced shortages in raw materials and containers, but thanks to strong support and worldwide collaboration with key suppliers, as well as the creativity of our technical and supply chain teams, we ensured our customers remained supplied.\nH.B. Fuller's ability to guarantee the supply of essential adhesives and provide innovative solutions that meet customer needs continues to be a competitive advantage for our company, as evidenced by our top-line growth.\nH.B. Fuller's revenue growth was widespread across all segments and geographical regions.\nCompared to the second quarter of 2020, organic revenues increased in each segment, with strong double-digit growth in both Engineering and Construction Adhesives segments, and solid growth in Hygiene, Health and Consumable Adhesives, despite a very strong second quarter in 2020.\nRevenues also grew in each geographical area, with organic growth of 19% in the Americas, 27% in EMEA, and 9% in the Asia-Pacific region.\nNotably, our revenues have also surpassed pre-COVID levels.\nCompared to the second quarter of 2019, which was unaffected by COVID-19, total organic revenues increased by 9.5%, with double-digit growth in HHC and Engineering Adhesives and mid-single-digit growth in Construction Adhesives.\nThe quarter's strong volume leverage, combined with pricing benefits and operational efficiencies we're implementing in the business, offset significantly higher raw material costs and led to a 21% year-over-year increase in EBITDA dollars.\nRaw material input costs rose by about 10% in the second quarter compared to the end of 2020, with some raw materials increasing more rapidly than we had anticipated.\nWe have implemented $150 million in annualized price adjustments so far and will implement an additional $75 million in the third quarter.\nWe are prepared to take further action if necessary.\nThese price adjustments will counteract the impact of raw material increases in this fiscal year.\nSuppliers have made significant progress in restoring capacity for the commodity and specialty chemicals we purchase.\nHowever, the recovery rate going forward will likely be uneven until inventory levels are rebuilt to fully meet demand.\nOur planning assumptions anticipate that the current supply volatility will decrease and pricing will begin to stabilize in the fourth quarter.\nWe now expect year-on-year raw material inflation to exceed 10% and anticipate that our pricing will fully offset raw material increases by the end of the third quarter.\nWe anticipate gross margin headwinds in the third quarter, which typically has slower volumes, and we expect to see additional pricing and margin benefits in the fourth quarter, which is usually our strongest volume quarter.\nOur global sourcing expertise, innovative chemistries, and operational agility were more crucial than ever this quarter and continue to provide a competitive edge.\nThe actions we've taken on pricing and to drive efficiencies across our business allowed us to seamlessly serve our customers and meet our profit targets for the quarter, while also increasing our debt reduction compared to last year, in line with our goal of $200 million in debt reduction for 2021.\nLet's now examine the performance of each segment during the second quarter, as shown on Slide 4.\nHygiene, Health and Consumable Adhesives experienced a 3.3% year-over-year increase in organic sales for the second quarter, which is remarkable given the comparison to last year's robust quarter when the business saw 7% organic growth.\nThe majority of our HHC markets saw increased sales compared to the previous year, with notable growth in packaging applications, beverage labeling, multiwall bags, and tape and label.\nHHC's segment EBITDA grew by 11%, surpassing the top-line growth, and EBITDA margin was impressive at 14.7%, showing a 70 basis point improvement from last year.\nThe margin enhancement was attributed to strong volume leverage, benefits from restructuring, and effective expense management.\nConstruction Adhesives reported a 23% increase in organic revenue compared to the previous year, with significant growth in both flooring and commercial roofing as market share gains and improving demand led to substantially better top-line performance than in 2020.\nCompared to the strong, non-COVID affected second quarter of 2019, organic revenue still showed a 4% increase.\nThe impact of pricing adjustments implemented in this segment was not fully reflected in the second quarter due to the fulfillment of backlogged Construction Adhesives orders following the temporary disruption caused by Storm Uri.\nWe have observed increased pricing taking effect in the initial weeks of the third quarter and anticipate further pricing realization in the P&L throughout the remainder of the year.\nConstruction Adhesives EBITDA rose by 4% compared to last year, as robust volumes were counterbalanced by increased raw material costs, unfavorable mix, and some temporary manufacturing expenses required to restore normal service levels after the extreme weather event in the first quarter.\nEngineering Adhesives delivered exceptionally strong results, with organic revenue growing by nearly 40% compared to last year, reflecting market share gains and improving end market demand.\nSales increased across all 14 of our Engineering Adhesives end markets compared to last year, with remarkable growth in adhesives for automotive, recreational vehicles, woodworking, electronics, and insulating glass.\nCompared to the non-COVID affected second quarter of 2019, organic revenues showed an 11% increase.\nWe anticipate continued strength and double-digit full-year growth in this segment.\nEngineering Adhesives' second quarter EBITDA grew by 42% year-on-year, driven by exceptional volume performance.\nWe expect EBITDA margins to improve in the coming quarters as pricing actions are fully implemented and offset the impact of raw material cost increases.\nLooking ahead to our full-year results, we assume economies will continue to reopen as vaccines are distributed globally.\nRaw materials are expected to remain tight for most of the year, with prices staying elevated as supply chains begin to normalize and demand remains strong.\nWe anticipate continued robust demand and market share gains in each of our business units, driving strong volume growth in 2021 compared to 2020.\nRevenue in most of our end markets is expected to surpass 2019 levels.\nOverall, considering our strategic pricing actions, combined with solid volume growth in HHC, ongoing improvement in Construction Adhesives, and strong demand in Engineering Adhesives, we now project full-year double-digit revenue growth compared to 2020.\nLet's begin with Slide 5, which provides additional financial details for the second quarter.\nNet revenue increased by 22.7% compared to the same period last year.\nCurrency had a positive impact of 3.9%.\nAdjusting for currency, organic revenue grew by 18.8%, with volume up 17.4% and pricing up 1.4%, most of which was realized in the latter half of the quarter.\nAll three GBUs demonstrated strong growth compared to both 2020 and the non-COVID affected second quarter of 2019, which we believe validates the strength of our top-line performance.\nWhen compared to Q2 2019, organic revenue increased by 9.5% for the entire company, with strong organic growth across all three GBUs.\nAdjusted gross profit rose by 17.4% year-on-year, while gross profit margin decreased by 120 basis points as volume growth and pricing gains were offset by higher raw material costs.\nAdjusted SG&A expenses decreased by 130 basis points as a proportion of revenue, due to volume leverage, business reorganization savings, and overall cost management, counterbalanced by increased variable compensation compared to the previous year.\nOverall, the adjusted operating income margin saw a 20 basis point improvement year-over-year.\nNet interest expenses reduced by $1.3 million, attributed to lower debt levels.\nThe quarter's adjusted effective income tax rate was 26.8%, down from 27.6% in the same period last year.\nQuarterly adjusted EBITDA of $122 million increased by 21% compared to the same period last year, propelled by robust volume growth, price increases, and restructuring savings, partially offset by higher raw material costs and variable compensation.\nAdjusted earnings per share rose by 38% to $0.94 compared to the second quarter of last year, reflecting strong income growth and reduced interest expense due to debt reduction.\nOperating cash flow in the first half of the year was $80 million, compared to $108 million in the same period last year, due to working capital requirements supporting strong top-line performance and increased raw material costs.\nWe continue to reduce our debt, repaying $62 million in the first half of 2021 compared to $51 million during the same period last year, keeping us on track for our annual debt reduction goal of $200 million.\nRegarding our future outlook, based on current information, we now anticipate full-year revenue growth to be in the low double-digits.\nWe maintain our previously increased adjusted EBITDA guidance range of $455 million to $475 million, considering our expectations for continued strong volume growth and accelerating pricing offsetting raw material cost increases, which we now expect to surpass 10% for the fiscal year.\nGiven our business seasonality and the timing of raw material and price increases, we expect third-quarter revenues to increase by about 15% compared to the third quarter of 2020, maintaining strong top-line growth.\nEBITDA margin in the third quarter is projected to be approximately 100 basis points lower than the second quarter sequentially.\nAs pricing actions are fully implemented, margins are expected to improve in the fourth quarter, which is also our strongest quarter in terms of volume.\nWe anticipate strong cash flow for the remainder of the year, allowing us to maintain our goal of reducing debt by approximately $200 million during 2021.\nDuring our previous conference call, I outlined three critical priorities for 2021 in the current supply-constrained, inflationary COVID recovery environment.\nThese priorities are volume growth, pricing strategy, and increased productivity, and we performed well against each of these key imperatives in the second quarter.\nOur primary focus is to drive volume growth by supporting our customers in the current high-demand and supply-constrained environment.\nVolume growth and market share gains are fundamental to creating lasting shareholder value.\nOur 19% second quarter organic revenue growth is particularly impressive considering our HHC business had a strong 7% organic growth in the second quarter last year.\nOverall, our business grew 9.5% compared to pre-COVID levels in the second quarter of 2019.\nOur second imperative is to strategically manage pricing, aligned with the value we provide, in this inflationary environment.\nWe implemented $150 million in price increases, effective from March 1 through July 15, and we're planning an additional $75 million in price increases later in Q3.\nWe are also fulfilling our third priority to increase productivity and capacity through our operational excellence programs.\nIn the second quarter, we outperformed competitors and supported customers, while our factory labor and overhead costs as a percentage of revenue decreased compared to the same quarter last year.\nCOVID-19 has transformed business operations, and supply constraints and pricing volatility are challenges affecting our industry today.\nIn this environment, H.B Fuller's strategic priorities, the advantages of our robust global operations and supply chain, our collaborative culture and market-based innovation, and the speed and agility we've developed across our company are delivering results for our customers and shareholders.\nWe will continue to navigate the challenges of a constrained supply environment, grow our business, and strengthen our leadership position in the global adhesive industry while delivering strong results for our customers and shareholders.\nLet's now open the call for questions.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Bill Furman, Greenbrier's executive chairman, Lorie Tekorius, CEO and president, Brian Comstock, executive vice president and chief commercial and leasing officer, and Adrian Downes, senior vice president and CFO, are accompanying me today.\nRecent weeks have been eventful both globally and at Greenbrier.\nLorie Tekorius took on the role of Greenbrier's CEO on March 1st.\nOur board of directors recently appointed Lorie as our newest board member.\nAs we commence today's call, I'd like to extend my congratulations to Lorie on her new positions at Greenbrier.\nWe take pride in how the board has managed this significant transition at Greenbrier.\nI'm glad to continue serving as executive chairman for the remainder of our fiscal year and as a board member and investor until 2024.\nLorie's appointment has increased our board's gender diversity, with four out of eleven directors now being female.\nAdditionally, three of our directors identify as people of color.\nAlthough Omicron continues to affect our operations, as you'll hear today, the situation is improving significantly.\nJust as those impacts begin to accumulate, the conflict in Ukraine has affected economies in all our operational areas.\nWe're witnessing a terrible tragedy, and I hope for a quick resolution to the conflict and an end to human suffering.\nWhile the war presents short-term challenges for everyone, it also creates opportunities for major changes in freight routes and transportation networks that will benefit Greenbrier's business as the world enters a new order.\nHistorical evidence shows the crucial role of railroads in supporting civilian life and economies, especially during wartime.\nThe ongoing war in Europe has directly impacted the availability and cost of various commodities, from minerals to food, fertilizer, crude oil, coal, and natural gas.\nRailways and their suppliers will play a key role in maintaining civilian life and economic function during this crisis.\nCommodity markets typically serve as leading indicators for growth in rail freight.\nMost rail-transported commodities are experiencing upward price pressure due to sanctions on Russia or reduced production from Russia and Ukraine.\nWe anticipate that rising global commodity prices and shifting trade patterns will boost railcar demand in North America, Brazil, and other parts of the world.\nEvolving energy policies in North America and Western Europe are already creating opportunities for rail transport of oil, ethanol, and other products.\nA similar impact is expected for fertilizers and other food production necessities.\nLastly, rising diesel costs present a significant opportunity for a shift from road to rail transport.\nRail freight is one of the most sustainable and fuel-efficient modes of surface transportation.\nU.S. freight trains with diesel-electric power generation are three to four times more fuel-efficient than trucks.\nConsider this: one ton of freight can be transported by rail for nearly 500 miles on a single gallon of fuel.\nMoreover, transporting freight by train instead of truck reduces greenhouse gas emissions by up to 75% per ton-mile and lessens congestion and wear on roads and bridges.\nAs more freight moves to rail, this may lead to longer railcar dwell times and reduced railroad speed in many cases.\nIn turn, railroad congestion necessitates more railcars to improve railroad service efficiency, notwithstanding the expected increase in demand for major commodities like fertilizer, food products, and other goods.\nWe acknowledge the role and responsibility our industry must fulfill during times of crisis and as the geopolitical landscape changes.\nThe cruel irony of this war in Ukraine is that there will ultimately be beneficiaries.\nWhile we can't choose the external factors that affect our business, we must always be prepared to face the challenges and seize the opportunities that come with them.\nGreenbrier has demonstrated its ability to thrive in adversity and capitalize on opportunities.\nI'm confident this legacy will continue under Lorie's leadership for years to come.\nI'll now hand over the call to Lorie to discuss our strong performance this quarter.\nBefore delving into our quarterly results, I'd like to express my appreciation to Bill and the rest of the Greenbrier Board for the opportunity to serve as CEO.\nWe have an exceptional team at Greenbrier who work diligently and intelligently every day.\nAlthough it's challenging to predict specific opportunities or challenges that may arise, I'm confident that the Greenbrier team has the experience, knowledge, and determination to make the most of any situation while focusing on increasing shareholder value.\nGreenbrier achieved strong results in this second quarter.\nDespite not all of our operating segments performing as expected, our highly diverse business performed very well overall.\nWe delivered 4,800 railcar units this quarter, a 17% increase from the previous quarter, driven by our core North American market.\nOur lease fleet utilization rose to 98%, and our leasing team generated substantial cash proceeds and gains through regular lease fleet optimization and monetization transactions.\nOur leasing business is surpassing our expectations as we achieve growth at scale.\nWe achieved our strong quarterly performance as the Omicron variant of COVID-19 reached its peak in the United States.\nTragically, in February, we lost Charles Wallace, a long-time employee in our maintenance services group, to COVID.\nCharles leaves behind a son and four sisters.\nWe extend our sympathies to them in their time of grief.\nAdditionally, we faced significant staff shortages this quarter as roughly 12% of our employees contracted the virus.\nLately, the number of infections has decreased, and we're optimistic that the pandemic's worst phase is now over.\nOur manufacturing gross margin percentage fell short of our expectations this quarter, affected by challenges in the supply chain and workforce.\nOur global procurement team continues to excel in managing severe disruptions to maintain increasing production rates while minimizing delays.\nWe have managed to avoid any production line closures across our network due to material shortages.\nExtra costs were incurred to source materials on the spot market and expedite deliveries.\nBusiness momentum is growing, and we anticipate better performance in upcoming quarters due to improved pricing and overhead absorption on higher production levels.\nThe situation in Europe is uncertain.\nThe time before and after the outbreak of war in Ukraine has created a highly unstable environment for many European manufacturers.\nOur operations have been affected by rapidly increasing energy costs and now finished steel and components in our supply chain.\nUkraine and Russia are among the largest providers of iron ore, finished steel, and wheelsets to European mines and welders.\nAs Bill pointed out, railways play a crucial role in supporting the economy during wartime.\nOur leadership team is collaborating with our customers and suppliers to maintain production and ensure the best outcomes for all involved parties.\nOur maintenance service business continued to be affected by higher material costs and labor shortages during the quarter, with the omicron variant having a particularly strong impact on the network of smaller workforces.\nWe are starting to see improved financial results from the action plan implemented to address these challenges in Q1.\nWe expect to maintain our momentum in the latter half of the year as we stay focused on executing our plans while also seeking additional ways to cut costs and improve margins.\nOur leasing and management services division had another successful quarter, driven by higher fleet utilization and regular asset optimization and monetization transactions.\nOur owned fleet has increased by over 25% since the end of fiscal 2021 to approximately 11,000 units.\nIn addition to managing our lease fleet, our management services, or GMS group, continues to offer innovative railcar solutions for over 25% of the North American rail freight fleet.\nWithin GMS, we're initiating a project to upgrade the service platform used to manage equipment and data.\nOne of the aims of this important project is to ensure scalable support for our leasing and syndication business as well as our external customers as we continue to implement our leasing strategy.\nLooking forward, we anticipate strong operating momentum to continue throughout fiscal 2022 and beyond.\nWe've managed to maintain our market-leading positions through disciplined execution and by preserving our strong liquidity position.\nThese were key aspects of our management team's plans at the beginning of the pandemic and they continue to serve us well.\nThere's no question that the market environment will remain dynamic, especially with the war in Europe.\nInflation, supply chain issues, and the ongoing human impact of the pandemic will persist for some time.\nWe are managing the business accordingly and maintain our optimistic market outlook.\nWe expect our operating metrics to continue improving as we progress through the next several quarters and beyond.\nAs we've mentioned before, market recoveries won't follow a straight path, and there will be obstacles along the way.\nWe're managing our business to anticipate these challenges wherever possible to continue providing solutions to our customers and ultimately, deliver value to our shareholders.\nAs I've said before, our leadership team has the experience, knowledge, and determination to make the most of any situation.\nWith that, I'll pass the call to Brian Comstock to provide an update on the current railcar demand environment and our leasing activity.\nGreenbrier secured new railcar orders for 8,500 units valued at $930 million.\nWith deliveries of 4,800 units in the quarter, the book-to-bill ratio increased to 1.8 times.\nOrders for the first half of the year have already surpassed 85% of fiscal 2021 activity.\nThe new railcar backlog of 32,100 units has a market value of $3.6 billion and provides multi-year visibility.\nThis is Greenbrier's largest backlog in six years.\nHistorically, when our backlog reaches this level, it includes several multi-year orders.\nIn this instance, there are few multi-year orders, which demonstrates the strength of the overall demand environment.\nFrom an operational standpoint, this means that a larger portion of our backlog is scheduled to enter production in the near term and translate to revenue sooner.\nAdditionally, as production space becomes more valuable, we anticipate multi-year orders to follow and pricing could continue to improve.\nAs a reminder, our new railcar backlog doesn't include 3,200 units valued at $180 million that are part of Greenbrier's refurbishment program.\nDue to the large scale and nature of this work, it takes place at our manufacturing facility, absorbing production capacity while contributing to overhead absorption.\nOur renovation initiative plays a crucial role in maintaining rail as the most eco-friendly form of land transportation.\nWe're thrilled about this expanding collaboration with our clients to sustainably modernize North America's aging rail vehicle inventory.\nThe fleet usage rate reached 98% by the end of the quarter.\nRental prices and conditions are progressively getting better, and we're observing high demand for both new and pre-owned leased equipment.\nAs a component of our improved leasing approach, GBX Leasing completed our first asset-backed securitization by issuing $323 million in investment-grade rated notes with an average interest rate of 2.9% and a projected repayment date of January 2029.\nOur financial team performed exceptionally this quarter, syndicating 1,400 units, the highest level of activity in almost two years.\nSyndication is a vital source of cash flow and earnings, and we anticipate continued robust syndication activity in the latter half of the year.\nAs many are aware, syndication and asset sales are crucial leasing activities that will continue to expand in the future.\nLooking forward, I remain positive about the building momentum, particularly given the strong demand environment in North America.\nGreenbrier is in an excellent position for a period of robust growth.\nI believe the combination of market dynamics, our focused management team's ability to capitalize on them, and their experience will yield results in this early stage of the railcar cycle that are significantly better than previous cycles.\nToday, I will highlight the quarter's achievements and reaffirm our guidance for the 2022 fiscal year.\nSecond-quarter highlights include $683 million in revenue, delivery of 4,800 units, including 400 units from our unconsolidated joint venture in Brazil.\nThe overall gross margin of 8% reflects ongoing effects from ramping up new railcar production, the impact of the omicron variant, efforts to mitigate supply chain and labor shortages, and an additional warranty provision for certain older railcars.\nSelling and administrative expenses of about $55 million increased sequentially, reflecting higher employee-related costs, consulting, travel, and legal expenses due to increased business activity.\nWe realized a $25 million net gain from equipment sales.\nThis activity was part of our ongoing strategy to optimize and monetize our leasing portfolio.\nNon-controlling interest provided a $1.6 million benefit, mainly due to the impact of production line changes and ramp-ups at our Mexican joint venture.\nThis showed improvement sequentially, and we expect our Mexican JV to be profitable in the second half of the year.\nNet earnings attributable to Greenbrier were approximately $13 million or $0.38 per diluted share, with EBITDA of about $52 million or 7.6% of revenue.\nDuring the quarter, we incurred $2.1 million in gross costs specifically related to COVID-19 employee and facility safety measures.\nThis expense increased by almost 75% sequentially and was our highest level in the last 12 months.\nGreenbrier's liquidity grew to $804 million at the end of Q2, comprising $587 million in cash and $217 million in available borrowings.\nOur strong balance sheet positions us well to navigate any market conditions.\nWe anticipate receiving a large portion of our $106 million tax refund in fiscal Q4, reflecting processing delays at the IRS.\nThis refund will be in addition to Greenbrier's existing cash and borrowing capacity.\nDuring and shortly after the quarter, Greenbrier entered into additional interest rate swaps to fix long-term floating rate debt for the next several years, reducing the risk of rising interest expenses in an increasing interest rate environment.\nBy the end of the second quarter, effectively all of our outstanding leasing debt was at fixed interest rates, and approximately 90% of our corporate non-leasing long-term debt was fixed.\nCombined with executing over $2 billion of new and refinanced borrowing facilities over the past year, including the ABS lease financing completed in Q2, this puts Greenbrier in a strong position moving forward.\nOn March 31, Greenbrier's board of directors declared a $0.27 per share dividend, our 32nd consecutive dividend.\nBased on yesterday's closing price, our annual dividend represents a yield of approximately 2.3%.\nSince reinstating the dividend in 2014, Greenbrier has returned nearly $380 million of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.\nBased on current business trends and production schedules, we're reaffirming Greenbrier's fiscal year 2022 outlook to include: deliveries of 17,500 to 19,500 units, including approximately 1,500 units from Greenbrier-Maxion in Brazil.\nAs a reminder, in fiscal 2022, approximately 1,400 units are expected to be built and added to our lease fleet.\nThese units are not included in the delivery guidance provided.\nWe consider a railcar delivered when it leaves Greenbrier's balance sheet and is owned by an external third party.\nSelling and administrative expense guidance remains unchanged and is expected to be approximately $200 million to $210 million.\nGross capital expenditures are projected to be approximately $275 million in leasing and management services, $55 million in manufacturing, and $10 million in maintenance services.\nNet of proceeds on equipment sales of $150 million, leasing capex is expected to be $125 million.\nGross margin percentage is anticipated to increase sequentially in Q3 and Q4, with Q4 margins between low double digits and low teens.\nIn conclusion, I want to echo the sentiments expressed by our colleagues earlier.\nSpecifically, Greenbrier will successfully navigate the challenges we face in the second half of the fiscal year.\nGreenbrier's highest backlog in more than half a decade, ample liquidity, and strong balance sheet make this possible.\nDespite the lingering effects of the multi-year pandemic and the impacts of war on an already stressed global supply chain, we are better positioned than ever to achieve our ambitious goals.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:I am called Matt Eichmann.\nPete Watson, Greif's president and CEO, Larry Hilsheimer, Greif's CFO, and Ole Rosgaard, Greif's COO, are accompanying me.\nQuestions will be accepted at the conclusion of today's call.\nTo comply with Regulation Fair Disclosure, please inquire about matters you deem significant, as we are not permitted to discuss material non-public information with you individually.\nKindly restrict yourself to a single question and one follow-up before rejoining the queue.\nThe actual outcomes may vary significantly from those discussed.\nWe value your interest in Greif, as always.\nThe group achieved outstanding results despite a challenging operating environment complicated by the pandemic, supply chain issues, and inflation beyond our control.\nThe 2021 fiscal year was remarkable, with record-breaking financial performance.\nWe substantially reduced our debt, enhanced shareholder returns, attained top-tier employee engagement, and were acknowledged as a premier workplace in the US.\nLooking forward, these achievements position us for an even brighter future, with our fiscal 2022 guidance indicating performance aligned with the commitments we set in 2019.\nLastly, over the past year, we made significant improvements to our already robust sustainability performance and have further integrated ESG into our business strategies.\nI'd like to invite Ole Rosgaard, our chief operating officer, to share some thoughts on ESG, which can be found on Slide 4.\nI trust you and your loved ones are doing well.\nIn my view, sustainability isn't an afterthought or corporate function, but a leadership priority that generates business value by minimizing risks and costs while creating new growth opportunities.\nWe reached several notable ESG milestones in 2021.\nFor instance, we diverted at least 90% of waste from landfills at over 140 of our global facilities, boosting our global diversion rate to approximately 85% from about 70% the previous year.\nEven more impressively, by year-end, 50 of our global facilities had achieved zero waste to landfill status.\nWe introduced our fourth Colleague Resource Group to offer professional development opportunities and further cultivate a more diverse and inclusive culture across Greif.\nLastly, we connected ESG KPIs to the Greif business system, enhancing our performance management capability to further advance this crucial work.\nThe key takeaway is that Greif's strong ESG focus is central to our plans for sustainable value creation.\nI'm eager to share additional highlights with you in the future.\nNow, I'll hand it back to Pete to discuss our business results on Slide 5.\nThe global industrial packaging division delivered exceptional fourth quarter results.\nOur overall global primary product line was robust and boosted sales by nearly 3% compared to the previous year.\nEMEA and ongoing recovery in our industrial end markets.\nGlobal steel drum volume decreased by 1.5% per day compared to the previous year.\nThe largest decline was in APAC, reflecting our decision to implement strategic pricing actions and supply chain disruptions that negatively affected our customers' operations.\nFourth quarter global steel drum volume was also impacted by performance in EMEA where volumes remained steady through most of the quarter but slowed in October as customers in this region encountered their own supply chain challenges.\nThe Americas region recorded strong mid-single-digit growth during the quarter.\nGenerally, our industrial end markets remain healthy.\nCustomers report solid order backlogs and strong underlying demand, but they face external supply chain disruptions.\nAcross GIP, we see little evidence of customers building inventory, but some are carrying more stock than usual due to supply chain disruptions affecting their ability to ship to their customers.\nGIP's generally higher volumes and increased average selling prices led to significantly higher segment sales and gross profit year over year.\nGIP's fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA increased by approximately $47 million due to higher sales, partially offset by increased raw material, manufacturing, and transportation costs.\nThe business also benefited from a $3 million FX tailwind.\nLooking ahead, we anticipate GIP's fiscal 2022 profits to be lower year over year, although we expect volume growth, contributions from new capex projects, and beneficial efficiency gains.\nEarnings will decrease due to the exceptional rise in steel prices providing a one-time benefit of approximately $100 million to GIP's fiscal 2021 results, which won't happen again\nWe expect GIP's usual profit pattern throughout the year to continue\nSales in paper packaging for the fourth quarter increased by about $120 million compared to the previous year, driven by higher volumes and increased published prices for containerboard and boxboard\nAdjusted EBITDA grew by approximately $10 million compared to the previous year, due to higher sales that were largely offset by increased costs in raw materials, manufacturing, and transportation, including a significant $51 million impact from higher OCC index costs and an unexpected $8 million increase in natural gas costs\nThe company received a one-time benefit of $4 million from a legal settlement reported in SG&A, which won't recur\nDemand for our paper products remains robust, with our combined mill backlogs exceeding eight weeks\nOur CorrChoice sheet feeder system experienced a 2.4% increase in fourth quarter volumes compared to the previous year\nDemand for durables, e-commerce, and the automotive supply chain for OEMs remains strong, with no signs of slowing down\nTube and core volumes in the fourth quarter increased by 7% per day compared to the previous year\nMost key end markets, including film, paper cores, textiles, and protective packaging, showed strong demand\nFor fiscal 2022, we anticipate significantly higher profits in paper packaging due to strong demand and continued implementation of published price increases\nOverall, our team delivered outstanding fourth quarter results despite significant external challenges\nFourth quarter net sales, excluding foreign exchange effects, increased by 35% compared to the same quarter last year due to higher volumes and selling prices\nAdjusted EBITDA increased by $57 million, including a $7 million combined benefit from foreign exchange and a one-time legal settlement\nIt's worth noting that our adjusted EBITDA result was achieved despite a $51 million OCC index headwind and approximately $40 million in non-volume related transportation and manufacturing inflation, including an unexpected $8 million natural gas cost increase\nInterest expenses decreased by $9 million compared to the same quarter last year due to lower debt balances\nWe also benefited from reaching a lower interest rate tier in our credit facility as a result of our substantial debt repayments\nBoth our fourth quarter GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were approximately 11%\nFourth quarter adjusted Class A earnings per share more than doubled to $1.93 per share\nFor fiscal 2021, we achieved adjusted Class A earnings per share of $5.60, a 74% improvement over the previous year and significantly exceeding our Q3 guidance\nPart of the earnings improvement was due to a lower-than-expected non-GAAP tax rate of 18.1%, which benefited from reserve releases due to audit settlements and statute of limitation expirations\nWe estimate that the lower tax rate compared to our guidance contributed $0.15 to fiscal 2021 results\nThe majority of our year-over-year earnings improvement came from disciplined operational execution\nFourth quarter adjusted free cash flow decreased by approximately $79 million compared to the previous year\nAlthough profits improved significantly, capital expenditures increased and working capital negatively impacted cash flow, primarily due to higher-than-anticipated raw material costs\nWorking capital was also negatively affected by lower-than-expected October volumes outside the U.S., as customers faced external challenges and ordered fewer drums\nNevertheless, our team is managing what it can control, with strong results and a significant 140 basis point improvement in trailing 12-month average working capital as a percentage of sales, decreasing to 10.8% year-over-year\nOur main capital priorities remain consistent: invest in the business as needed to create value and support growth, provide shareholders with an attractive and growing dividend, and reduce our debt while maintaining a compliance leverage ratio between 2 and 2.5 turns\nOur financial position is solid\nWe plan to invest between $150 million and $170 million in capital expenditures for fiscal 2022 and aim to increase our dividend in 2022, as mentioned in previous calls\nWe are currently in our strategic planning process to determine the focus and extent of future growth activities to responsibly leverage our strong financial position for the benefit of our shareholders\nWe are pleased to introduce fiscal 2022 guidance that fulfills the commitments we made over two years ago\nOur guidance reflects the significant improvements we've made in our core business over the past few years, including the successful integration of Caraustar and realization of synergies, and demonstrates Greif's resilience in overcoming unforeseen and substantial external challenges posed by COVID and dramatic inflationary pressures beyond our control\nAt the midpoint, we expect to generate $6.15 of adjusted Class A earnings per share in 2022\nOverall, we anticipate that lower profits in GIP in fiscal 2022 will be more than offset by higher profitability and EPS, once again highlighting the advantage of our diversified portfolio\nInterest expenses will be significantly lower in fiscal 2022 due to our aggressive debt reduction, and we expect further improvements when we refinance our 6.5% 2027 senior notes sometime in the first half of calendar year 2022\nWe project adjusted free cash flow for 2022 to be between $400 million and $460 million\nAlong with higher capital spending, we expect a substantial increase in cash tax for fiscal '21, primarily due to greater pre-tax earnings.\nWe expect working capital to become a source of cash again.\nIn 2021, it consumed $222 million as the cost of raw materials rapidly increased.\nLet me share some thoughtful observations for you to ponder.\nIn my view, today's Greif is vastly different from the company it was six years ago.\nOur profit margins have become more stable and grown, our earnings have significantly increased, and we've been praised for improving our transparency and communication.\nWe've maintained a consistent, disciplined, and predictable approach to capital allocation.\nWe've fulfilled our promises and continue to create greater value for our shareholders.\nDespite these improvements, our stock still trades at a discount compared to our historical valuations and the broader market.\nFor instance, using our historical free cash flow yield of 11% and the midpoint of our 2022 free cash flow guidance would suggest a total market value of about $3.9 billion, which is roughly 30% higher than our current valuation.\nWhile we can't control our stock price, we believe our company deserves more attention given the current discount in our shares.\nI'm going to deviate from my prepared remarks for a moment.\nAs most or all of you know, this is Pete Watson's final earnings call.\nPete exemplifies leadership and has formed personal connections with many Greif employees through direct interaction.\nHe's a modest and respected leader who draws on his background in athletic coaching to build a unified team.\nWhen Pete took over leadership at Greif, many aspects of the company were in disarray.\nSince becoming CEO in November 2015, the results have been remarkable.\nSafety has steadily improved, and employee engagement has dramatically increased, placing us in the top 10% of Gallup's industrial sector.\nThese engaged employees have provided outstanding customer service and driven a significant improvement, doubling our Net Promoter Scores during this time.\nThis focus on the virtuous service profit chain has led to exceptional financial improvements.\nFrom 2015 to 2021, [inaudible] and EBITDA have roughly doubled.\nAdjusted EBITDA earnings per share has increased from $2.18 to $5.60 without any stock buybacks.\nAdjusted free cash flow, which was $70 million in 2015, has averaged nearly $300 million in the last three years and will surpass $400 million in 2022.\nPete has worked diligently to ensure a smooth succession plan, leaving Greif in capable hands going forward, securing his legacy as an outstanding leader.\nYou certainly did deviate from the script, and it's much appreciated.\nThank you, Larry, for your comments and thoughts.\nYou're a good person.\nAs Larry mentioned, this is my last earnings call as President and CEO of Greif.\nIt's a great company, and it's been my honor to serve our global Greif team.\nI'm extremely proud of what we've accomplished together over the past six years, as Larry described.\nI'm incredibly grateful to all our colleagues for their passion, dedication to excellence, and commitment to our team and customers.\nWhile fiscal 2021 was a record year for our company, I'm even more excited about what the future holds.\nWe're well-positioned to benefit from ongoing strength and improving trends in our key markets, and our extensive global portfolio, differentiated service capabilities, and focus on operational execution allow us to best serve our customers' needs and generate significant shareholder value.\nThe board and I are confident in Ole Rosgaard's ability to lead Greif going forward.\nHis operational background, strategic mindset, and passion for team building and customer service will be beneficial to Greif's future.\nI look forward to seeing the company thrive under his leadership.\nIt has been a pleasure working with all of you, and we appreciate your interest in Greif.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Additional information that may be useful can be found on our website, where we have uploaded our conference call slides.\nThis quarter's revenue amounted to $367 million, representing a 14% decline compared to the same period last year.\nGrowth from acquisitions contributed two percentage points this quarter, while fluctuations in currency exchange rates reduced sales by about one percentage point.\nThe quarter's net earnings were $29 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, including $30 million or $0.20 related to impairment charges from the sale of the Alco business.\nAfter accounting for the impairment and other tax adjustments, net earnings came to $62 million, or $0.37 per diluted share.\nWe began discussions to sell the U.K. valve business, Alco, which is heavily exposed to oil and natural gas markets, during the second quarter.\nThe Process segment includes Alco operations, which contributed $7 million in sales and $2 million in operating losses year-to-date.\nDue to the sale negotiations, we reassessed our investment in Alco in the second quarter, resulting in non-cash impairment charges of $34 million after tax, including $24 million of previously unrecognized foreign currency translation losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income.\nThe $24 million loss reserve for previously unrecognized foreign currency translation is recorded as other current liability at the end of the second quarter and will be cleared through accumulated other comprehensive income in the third quarter, as the sale was completed in early July.\nIn the second quarter, our gross margin rate was 49.8%, about three percentage points lower than the same period last year.\nThis was mainly due to changes in product and channel mix, with increased sales in the Contractor segment and double-digit declines in the Industrial and Process segments, as well as reduced factory output and currency translation rate changes.\nPricing improvements were favorable.\nUnabsorbed factory costs will continue to impact gross margin rates in the second half if sales volumes don't recover, although strong pricing improvements partially offset this effect.\nGross margin rates can be influenced by shifts in product and channel mix.\nOur global procurement team has been collaborating closely with our supply chain to ensure continuous operation throughout the quarter.\nWe are closely monitoring the supply chain for certain components, which is under pressure due to growth in specific products in the Contractor segment, particularly those for the home center channel.\nExcluding the impact of the impairment, operating expenses decreased by $12 million compared to the second quarter of last year, as reductions in volume and earnings-based expenses outweighed increased product development costs.\nThe reported income tax rate for the quarter was 31%, which is 13 percentage points higher than the same period last year, primarily due to non-deductible impairment charges.\nAfter adjusting for the impairment effect, excess tax benefits from stock option exercises, and other non-recurring tax benefits, our tax rate for the quarter was 19%, one percentage point lower than last year.\nOperational cash flows amounted to $143 million for the year so far, compared to $164 million in the previous year, due to decreased revenue.\nYear-to-date capital investments reached $33 million as we continue to enhance our production capabilities and expand various facilities.\nDividend payments totaled $58 million year-to-date.\nDuring the second quarter, we acquired a company for $27 million, which will be integrated into the Process division.\nFor the entire year of 2020, we anticipate capital expenditures to reach approximately $80 million, with about $50 million allocated for facility expansion projects.\nThis quarter, we bought back $17 million worth of shares, net of issuances, bringing our total net share repurchases to $62 million for the year.\nWe may consider additional opportunistic share buybacks in the future.\nLet's discuss a few final points regarding the remainder of the year.\nOur presentation's eleventh slide displays the six-week average bookings for each segment.\nThese booking averages cover the six weeks leading up to July 17.\nGiven current exchange rates and assuming similar volume, product mix, and sales distribution by currency as last year, we expect the exchange rate impact to be insignificant on sales but to negatively affect earnings by about one percent in 2020.\nWe project unallocated corporate expenses to be around $30 million for the full year 2020, with potential quarterly variations.\nThe expected effective tax rate for the full year is approximately 20% to 21%, excluding one-time items and any impact from excess tax benefits related to stock option exercises.\nConsidering the tumultuous second quarter, I'll focus my remarks on our operational status, strategic priorities, sales trends throughout the quarter, and provide some observations on end markets.\nOur primary factories and distribution centers remained fully functional during the second quarter.\nEmployees at high risk stayed home, and we managed positive COVID-19 cases at various facilities without disrupting operations.\nWe've largely avoided layoffs or pay cuts by reducing temporary labor in certain factories and reassigning our workforce to areas of greater need.\nAll our major factories had sufficient work to keep our full-time employees productive.\nOverall, I'm very impressed with the resilience our employees have demonstrated and continue to show throughout this pandemic.\nWe've maintained momentum on our growth strategies, as mentioned in our previous quarterly update.\nSecond quarter cost reductions were primarily due to variable expenses like rebates and incentives, decreased travel costs, and careful management of discretionary spending.\nOur investment in future initiatives for 2021 and beyond has remained steady.\nWhile this approach may impact our near-term financial performance, it will enable us to take advantage of improved market conditions when they occur.\nOverall order trends showed sequential improvement throughout the quarter.\nHowever, this improvement varied between different segments of our business.\nOur Contractor business recovered strongly in June after a dismal April, resulting in modest growth for the quarter.\nThe professional paint channel saw improvement as paint stores reopened for in-person shopping.\nThe Home Center business has been exceptionally busy for most of the quarter, leading to operational challenges in meeting the surge in demand.\nWe anticipate a positive outlook for the Contractor business in the latter half of the year.\nIn contrast, our Industrial business only saw slight improvement following a significant downturn in April.\nWhile access to customer facilities is gradually improving and we're seeing increased quoting activity in many sectors, we haven't yet observed a significant rebound in orders.\nThe global automotive industry is struggling, industrial production has decreased, the oil and gas sector is weak, and ongoing uncertainty is affecting most end users' willingness to invest in capital equipment.\nThe future of our Industrial segment remains uncertain, and I'm not particularly optimistic about its performance in the second half of the year.\nOur Process business didn't experience as severe a decline in April.\nAlthough it was down by double digits for the quarter, we've observed some positive trends in certain end markets.\nWithin this business, we have stronger performing sectors like semiconductor and environmental, as well as weaker ones such as our lubrication business, which has performed similarly to our Industrial segment.\nGiven the diverse range of end markets we serve, our outlook for the second half of the year remains uncertain.\nI'm confident that our strategy of continuing to invest in growth initiatives, such as developing new products and entering new markets, will position us well to achieve strong results once conditions normalize.\nWe employed a similar strategy during the 2008-2009 economic crisis, which ultimately benefited our investors, and we aim to replicate this success.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:My name is Patrick Suehnholz and I serve as the head of investor relations at Greenhill.\nScott Bok, our chairman and CEO, will also be participating in this call.\nThese declarations are founded on our present expectations concerning future occurrences which, due to their nature, lie beyond the company's control and are susceptible to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and suppositions.\nTo understand some of the risks and elements that could impact the company's future outcomes, please refer to our submissions to the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our yearly report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K.\nWe announced fourth-quarter earnings of $106.7 million, with a 39% operating margin and $1.05 per share in net income.\nThe company's full-year results showed revenue of $301 million, a 15% operating margin, and net income of $0.45 per share.\nOur quarterly earnings increased by 20%, and our earnings per share grew by 133% compared to the same time last year.\nFor the entire year, our revenue decreased by 14%, and our earnings per share dropped by 68%.\nOverall, we concluded the year strongly, yielding satisfactory full-year results in terms of both revenue and profit, aligning with our statements from recent quarterly investor discussions.\nAlthough industry data indicates a reduction in global transaction activity compared to the previous year, and nearly all of our competitors have reported decreases in advisory revenue, the main reason for our reduced annual revenue was that lower earnings in Europe outweighed increases in North America, Australia, and other regions.\nRegarding the types of advice we provide, we saw a significant boost in restructuring advisory revenue compared to recent years, as our newly expanded team gained more traction throughout the year.\nOur capital advisory team performed well again, though it didn't reach the record revenue level of the previous year.\nIn terms of M&A, results were relatively robust almost everywhere except Europe.\nAcross industry sectors, we achieved good results in consumer products, financial services, and media, which were offset by weaker performance in energy, healthcare, and technology.\nRegarding expenses, our compensation ratio for the year was 59%, slightly above our target due to lower annual revenue.\nFor the quarter, the compensation ratio was an unusually low 42% to balance out the exceptionally high ratios in the first two quarters of the year.\nOur management goal, as always, is to achieve a reasonable compensation ratio for the entire year while ensuring our team receives competitive compensation relative to their individual performance.\nOur non-compensation operating costs for the quarter totaled $21 million, exceeding last year's figure by $3.7 million due to foreign currency losses and a charge for an uncollectible account from a financially troubled client.\nThe annual non-compensation operating expenses remained relatively unchanged from the previous year, as unusual costs this year roughly equaled the accounting charge related to the Cogent acquisition earnout in the prior year.\nWe are closely tracking non-compensation expenses and aim to reduce the annual amount in 2020.\nThis quarter's interest expense decreased slightly compared to last year, as the cost of increased borrowing was offset by lower market interest rates and a reduced coupon premium following our advantageous refinancing in early 2019.\nWe anticipate a continued decline in our interest expenses in the future.\nThe effective tax rate was 33% for the quarter and 40% for the year.\nBoth periods' tax rates were adversely affected by an unusually low proportion of revenue and profit from lower-tax regions, particularly the U.K., and a higher proportion from higher-tax areas like Australia and Brazil.\nThe annual tax rate was further negatively impacted by an unfavorable difference between grant and market prices for vesting restricted stock units.\nWe anticipate the tax rate to generally remain in the mid-20% range in the future.\nRegarding capital returns, we've been actively repurchasing shares, believing the market undervalues our earnings potential and noting our stock's lower valuation multiple compared to peers and historical levels.\nWe bought 1.5 million shares and equivalents at an average of $15.98 per share during the quarter.\nThroughout the year, we acquired 3.8 million shares and equivalents at an average of $18.04 per share.\nOur Board has approved $60 million for share and equivalent purchases in 2020, compared to $69 million spent in 2019.\nSo far this quarter, we've repurchased 345,723 common stock shares at an average of $16.47 per share, totaling $5.7 million, leaving $54.3 million in repurchase authority for the rest of the year.\nWe've also declared a quarterly dividend of $0.05 per share.\nWe concluded the year with $114 million in cash and $365.6 million in debt, resulting in a net debt of $251.6 million.\nAs of yesterday, our cash balance increased to $133.9 million despite January's additional share repurchases, while the debt amount remained unchanged.\nOur principal debt payments are relatively small until our debt matures in 2024.\nGiven our business prospects, as outlined below, we aim to significantly reduce our debt in 2020 while also increasing share buybacks as mentioned earlier.\nWe begin 2020 with a positive outlook across all our business segments.\nThe climate for mergers and acquisitions appears promising in the regions that were successful for us in 2019, and our current European project pipeline suggests the potential for a substantial revenue increase there this year.\nIn restructuring advisory services, we concluded 2019 with significantly higher monthly retainer fees and a much larger backlog of projects expected to be completed in 2020.\nRecent tightening of credit availability and rising costs for less creditworthy borrowers should also benefit this business segment.\nIn capital advisory, the ongoing growth of private equity funds and increased market liquidity for chief investment officers invested in these funds should create a favorable operating environment for that business as well.\nI'll conclude with a brief overview of our strategy.\nWe continue to focus on building a business with more diverse revenue streams and higher overall revenue.\nThis was the rationale behind our acquisition of capital advisory specialist Cogent Partners nearly five years ago, the recent expansion of our restructuring advisory team, last year's growth in Singapore and France, and our ongoing recruitment of M&A specialists across various industry sectors.\nRecruitment will remain crucial to our growth plans, as will the continued internal development of talent.\nIn the past year, we added a net five client-facing managing directors, bringing our total to 79, and increased our overall professional headcount by 11%.\nWe have all

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:We truly value your time and interest in Graham Corporation today.\nDan Thoren, our president and CEO, and Jeff Glajch, our chief financial officer, are participating in this call with me.\nYou should have received the third quarter fiscal 2022 financial results, which were released moments ago.\nThe release and accompanying slides for our discussion can be accessed on our website, grahammanufacturing.com, or our new investor relations site, ir.grahamcorp.com.\nThese materials are also available on the SEC website.\nWe will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures during this call, which we believe are helpful in evaluating our performance.\nWe have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures in the tables accompanying today's release and slides for your reference.\nI'm beginning on Page 3.\nAs a new CEO who took on the role in September, presenting this fiscal third quarter's results is somewhat challenging.\nWhile revenue increased to $28.8 million, we experienced a loss of $0.35 per share.\nThe loss stemmed from cost overruns on Navy projects at our Batavia operations, resulting from decisions made to ensure timely completion of crucial submarine and carrier projects.\nThese decisions, which prioritized long-term benefits over short-term gains, were carefully considered.\nOur Navy business is crucial for our future, and we needed to protect it by demonstrating our commitment to meeting deadlines, despite the significant financial impact on this quarter and fiscal year 2022.\nJeff and I will provide more details in the following slides.\nDue to the quarterly loss, we breached our financial covenants, necessitating the suspension of our dividend.\nJeff will elaborate on the waiver we obtained and the upcoming amendment to our credit facility.\nDespite this disappointing quarter and challenging year, we remain committed to our strategy of diversifying beyond refining and petrochemicals through our defense work.\nOur pivot towards defense has been successful, as evidenced by our bookings and revenue, with defense revenue now comprising over half of our total revenue.\nWe had an exceptional bookings quarter, totaling $68 million, with over half coming from Barber-Nichols.\nNow that we have secured these bookings, our focus is on executing this work profitably.\nLastly, Barber-Nichols' performance is surpassing our expectations, building a larger backlog and delivering strong margins.\nJeff will provide more financial details, but first, I'd like to elaborate on our Navy challenges in Batavia.\nLet's move to Slide 4.\nI'll begin by explaining the factors leading to our third quarter performance.\nTo date, Graham Manufacturing has successfully earned the trust and confidence of the U.S. Navy and its prime shipbuilders with high-quality heat exchange and vacuum products for nuclear Navy power plants.\nNavy orders and backlog continue to grow, now significantly exceeding our commercial backlog and soon to surpass our commercial revenue.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our Navy backlog in Batavia exceeded $100 million.\nThese orders come with high expectations.\nAs we've worked to win new business and meet these expectations over the past two years, a perfect storm developed in our third quarter.\nSeveral events necessitated adjustments in Q3.\nAfter beginning work on Colombia, a Navy-wide reset of quality requirements caused delays in welder and quality recertification.\nThis was followed by COVID-19 impacts, ongoing shortages of skilled welders, and the sheer volume of work in our shop, combined with first article learning curves, all contributing to delays in our Navy jobs.\nWe continue to face first article challenges, which is typical for defense projects and expected for the Columbia project.\nWhile the CVN-80 work isn't a true first article job for us, the lack of process documentation from previous work, combined with severe labor challenges and the use of new contract welders, caused difficulties with the carrier work as well.\nEven as we worked to catch up on hours, our equipment became the critical factor in our nation's most strategic ship and submarine build schedules.\nThe pressure to expedite was intense.\nLet's turn to Page 5.\nThe chart on Page 5 illustrates our labor plan with blue bars, actual labor application in gray bars, and the resulting deficit of hours caused by actual being less than our planned hourly expenditure.\nThe labor deficit peaked around May 2021.\nIn previous calls, we discussed redirecting commercial welders to Navy work and hiring contract welders to address this deficit.\nIn the third quarter, we further redirected commercial welders, outsourced more commercial work, hired additional contract welders, and added new welders who completed our training programs.\nThese actions helped reverse the Navy labor deficit but came at additional costs.\nOutsourcing commercial work resulted in lower margins.\nWe also saw reduced third quarter revenue as outsourced suppliers couldn't ramp up quickly.\nContract welder costs were high, specialized Navy training took time, and retention of contract welders was poor.\nUltimately, we've managed to reduce our Navy program labor deficit by doubling our Navy workforce, mitigating schedule slips, and maintaining strong customer relationships.\nWe expect to eliminate the deficit in the first half of fiscal '23 and begin reducing high-cost contract welders as we enter the next fiscal year.\nThe actions taken to stay on track last quarter led to revised estimates on labor hours and materials, and we booked loss conversion costs that impacted our quarterly results.\nJeff will provide more details in the financial briefing.\nWe've learned valuable lessons from this experience and have implemented or will implement corrective and preventative measures to ensure continued growth in our Navy business, timely delivery of quality products, and fair returns for our efforts.\nOur customers have appreciated our efforts, and we don't anticipate negative consequences if we maintain current deliveries.\nThis equipment is integral to these ships and will remain in place permanently.\nQuality is of utmost importance, and Graham has met expectations.\nAs we address these programs and reduce our workforce shortage, we can improve margins by removing temporary welders, reassigning our commercial welders to their original roles, and decreasing our current outsourcing.\nMaintaining our employee pipeline remains crucial, and we will continue our welder training initiative.\nIn hindsight, we could have better anticipated and addressed the situation with more developed financial planning, analysis, and project management capabilities.\nWe are bringing in new personnel with defense experience in Batavia to enhance management of these processes.\nWe are creating a new role, and Batavia will have a Navy business leader starting on February 28.\nMoving forward, we need to improve our processes to better document and optimize all our fabrication methods to avoid repeating the initial article issues we've encountered.\nWe see potential to boost future earnings by investing in time-efficient automated welding, and we're reassessing current contract margins and reconsidering pricing for upcoming production opportunities.\nIn conclusion, our Batavia defense operations faced a combination of challenges at a very unfortunate time.\nWe made choices to safeguard our strategic Navy business.\nThis resulted in short-term losses but demonstrated our commitment to our customers in the long run.\nAs Dan noted, our third quarter results were very disappointing.\nRevenue was $28.8 million, an increase of $1.6 million compared to the same quarter last year.\nBarber-Nichols contributed $12 million in sales for the quarter, helping to counterbalance the weak sales performance of our traditional Graham manufacturing business.\nOur Batavia operations were affected due to the need to prioritize catching up and executing the two major Navy projects.\nThese projects will require more labor and material expenses to finish than initially projected at the beginning of the quarter.\nThe additional labor hours needed to complete the projects impacted the quarter's revenue as we didn't progress the projects as far as anticipated.\nThe increased labor and material costs, including the use of more expensive contract workers, required us to record higher reserves.\nThe combination of these factors affected both revenue and gross margin.\nThe impact of the cost increases and required fully burdened contract costs in the quarter amounted to $2 million.\nAdditionally, the delayed revenue was approximately $6 million, and the delayed operating profit is around $750,000.\nMoreover, to get back on schedule with the Navy projects, we reassigned our commercial labor to Navy work, resulting in increased cost estimates for those jobs, which have now been outsourced.\nAll of these factors contributed to an adjusted EBITDA of negative $2.6 million in the quarter and an adjusted net loss of $0.27 per share.\nOn a positive note, with the addition of Barber-Nichols, 58% of our sales were to the defense industry, along with 5% or $1.5 million to the space industry.\nLet's move on to Slide 7.\nThe impact of the third quarter results, combined with a challenging first half of the year, has resulted in an unacceptable loss despite sales increasing by 16% or $11.3 million to $83.1 million.\nThere is a bright spot within the results, which has been the contributions of Barber-Nichols, acquired on June 1.\nIn the seven months since the acquisition, BN has contributed $31.9 million in sales, offsetting significant declines in refining and petrochemical markets.\nOur diversification into defense, which is less cyclical than our commercial business, has resulted in 52% of our year-to-date revenue coming from that industry.\nThe shortfall in commercial sales in the first nine months of the fiscal year reflects the very low order levels we experienced in the second half of fiscal 2021.\nThe two Navy projects in our Batavia operations will continue to convert over the next three quarters, and we expect this to be resolved by mid-fiscal 2023.\nAs of December 31, we have recorded all known expected costs on these large projects.\nWe are implementing expanded processes within our project management group to better review all of Batavia's major projects.\nThe year-to-date impact of increased costs on these two jobs is approximately $4.5 million.\nAdditionally, the delayed revenue was approximately $12 million and the delayed operating profit is an additional $1.5 million.\nThese latter amounts will be recognized over the next three quarters as the jobs are completed.\nWe've had to outsource more commercial work and have also faced cost challenges on a couple of projects.\nThis has also impacted financial results.\nThe increased cost of outsourcing and higher costs has impacted the commercial business by $3 million.\nAll of these factors contributed to an adjusted EBITDA of negative $5.4 million year-to-date, and a year-to-date net loss of $0.70 a share and an adjusted loss of $0.60 per share.\nBarber-Nichols continues to be a strong positive in the first three quarters.\nIn the seven months since the acquisition, BN sales are on track at $31.9 million, and EBITDA margins are well ahead of expectations.\nI have mentioned in previous calls that we were expecting $45 million to $48 million in sales and low double-digit EBITDA margins.\nThe sales number is on target, and we are now seeing mid-teen EBITDA.\nIn fact, through seven months since the acquisition, BN has achieved our targeted EBITDA for the full fiscal year.\nSo its Q4 EBITDA will exceed our expectations.\nLet's move on to Slide 8.\nGiven the weak financial performance in the first three quarters, we have not met our debt covenant related to debt-to-EBITDA and fixed cost charges.\nThis miss was due to the EBITDA loss.\nWe received a waiver from our lender for Q3 and are actively negotiating to amend our existing bank agreement.\nDue to the covenant misses, we had to suspend our dividend.\nAs part of the waiver agreement, we have agreed not to use more than $15 million of our revolver.\nI want to emphasize that the issues we are facing are related to P&L profit, not liquidity.\nWe have sufficient liquidity from cash generated from operations to address our challenges.\nIn fact, in January alone, we reduced our revolver debt from $9.75 million to $6 million.\nWe expect to lower it further between now and the end of March.\nDiscussions with our lender have been very positive.\nI'm pleased with the bank's willingness to understand the details and not overreact to the numbers.\nThey recognize that the near-term challenges are primarily related to profitability and delayed revenue.\nWhile there are certainly some significant cash cost increases, the costs booked in Q3 and the extension of project revenue and profit recognition into future quarters have compounded the impact on our year-to-date P&L.\nBoth the bank and I anticipate the lending amendment to be completed by the end of Q4.\nHere are the paraphrased sentences:\nWe have some excellent news regarding orders to share on Slide 9.\nAs mentioned by Dan, Q3 orders totaled $68 million.\nBarber-Nichols contributed slightly more than half of this amount, with the majority of their orders coming from key defense projects.\nThey also continue to secure a good quantity and range of space-related orders.\nGraham manufacturing experienced another robust quarter for aftermarket and short-cycle orders in the commercial sector.\nThis is encouraging as historically, growth in these areas has often preceded a revival in capital investment from our clients.\nWe also secured a major refinery contract in China.\nOur end-of-Q3 backlog stands at a record $272.6 million, with both Barber-Nichols and the original Graham business showing significant increases in their respective backlogs during the quarter.\nDefense accounts for 77% of the total backlog.\nThis defense backlog extends over the next six years, although a large portion will be converted in the next three to four years.\nFurthermore, we are observing growth in our commercial backlog.\nThe commercial backlog was significantly low at the start of the fiscal year.\nIt has increased from $33 million at the end of March to $63 million currently.\nApproximately one-quarter of this increase occurred when we incorporated BN, while the remainder was due to orders received in the first nine months of the year.\nAnother positive aspect of the commercial backlog and its growth is its much shorter conversion cycle compared to the defense backlog, typically 12 to 18 months.\nDespite a challenging fiscal 2022, the outlook for the future appears much more promising.\nLet's proceed to Slide 10.\nWe have revised our guidance for fiscal 2022 downward.\nOur updated revenue guidance is now $120 million to $125 million, implying $37 million to $42 million in Q4.\nWe anticipate a break-even adjusted EBITDA in Q4.\nAlthough this falls short of our previous expectations, it's considerably better than Q3 results, and we believe we've overcome many of the challenges we faced this fiscal year.\nI'll now hand the call back to Dan to discuss our future strategy.\nWe're now on Slide 11.\nAt a broad level, we've been discussing a strategic shift towards defense for several years, and we've been making good progress.\nThe long-term visibility of strategic naval programs provides stability and allows us to invest wisely in our business, offsetting the cyclicality and challenges of our refining and petrochemical markets.\nThe acquisition of Barber-Nichols reinforced this strategy and brought additional market expertise to our company.\nAs with any new venture, we've learned some lessons and identified opportunities to further strengthen our strategy.\nI'd like to share some insights on how our strategy is evolving going forward.\nLet's move to Page 12.\nGraham Corporation is a group of related mission-critical engineered product companies that excel through superior quality, performance, and customer trust.\nOur corporate role is to enhance our member companies with best practices, leader rotation, and board expertise while providing value-adding services and core collaboration to secure large programs.\nWe are currently filling critical leadership positions and upgrading talent to meet the future needs of Graham Corporation.\nOur board took on this requirement themselves last year after the BN acquisition, initiating a search for director candidates with strong defense experience.\nOur Batavia operations, now referred to as Graham manufacturing, will continue to serve the Navy, refining, and petrochemical markets with high-quality, highly engineered heat transfer and vacuum systems.\nIt is expanding into new energy and will now focus more on aftermarket opportunities to become a life cycle partner with our customers.\nInternally, we are restructuring to accommodate significant Navy growth and will leverage our large installed base for growth capital.\nOur strengths will help us achieve our goals.\nIn Batavia, we aim to achieve strong margins in all our markets, improve our operational effectiveness, and develop capabilities to provide more value to our customers.\nWe need to establish clear roles and responsibilities aligned with a structure designed to be responsive, analytical, and forward-thinking.\nWe must create an organization that is accountable and can diagnose problems, evaluate alternatives, improve, develop, reshape, and quickly redirect as needed.\nCrucially, we need to ensure our people have the necessary tools, materials, and information to perform their jobs effectively.\nBarber-Nichols continues to focus on intelligent full life cycle turbomachinery systems in identified high-growth potential markets.\nBN has largely established the necessary people, technology, and customer relationships.\nThey are advancing to the next level in teams, processes, and improvements to optimize business performance, while working even more closely with customers to develop new products and ensure year-over-year growth.\nOur future opportunities will result from proper execution of our plans, which will help us overcome these short-term challenges.\nWe believe this is the turning point.\nWe have undoubtedly reached the bottom, so I'm confident we can only go up from here.\nI understand that we need to demonstrate our ability to drive earnings and generate cash.\nAs Jeff mentioned, we have already begun to do so in the first month of 2022.\nLooking to our future, we view the BN acquisition as a model to replicate.\nSeveral novel approaches were used that we believe can attract the best and brightest small independent companies to join us.\nWe are an organization undergoing dynamic change.\nWe serve excellent markets.\nWe have earned our customers' confidence.\nOur orders and backlog serve as proof.\nWe have faced execution challenges but have identified the issues and implemented corrective measures.\nWe have a growth plan in place.\nWe believe we have a robust business model with excellent earnings potential and cash generation capabilities.\nAlthough we have several quarters of work ahead to complete these projects, we are on an upward trajectory.\nJeff and I will now take questions from the audience.\nSummary: ",

linked with pricing, volume, market conditions, unfavorable developments in the worldwide economy as well as the public health emergency related to COVID-19 and its subsequent effects on demand for new and pre-owned vehicles and associated services.\nAmbiguity regarding the length and intensity of COVID-19 and its effect on U.S. and international authorities' ability to relax current restrictions on various commercial and economic activities.\nLack of clarity concerning the timing, speed, and extent of economic recovery in the U.S. and elsewhere from the unknown present and future impacts of COVID-19 and unforeseen future effects of oil producers and their influence on travel, transportation, and oil prices, which will likely negatively affect demand for our vehicles and service.\nAdditionally, our capability to acquire a desired inventory of new and pre-owned vehicles and the impact of supply chain disruptions, which may happen periodically.\nFurthermore, our ability to sustain vehicle profit margins and implement and maintain cost controls and preserve sufficient liquidity for operations.\nThese dangers and other risks are outlined in the company's submissions to the Securities and Exchange Commission over the past 12 months.\nDuplicates of these filings are accessible from both the SEC and the company.\nAs mandated by applicable SEC regulations, the company provides reconciliations of any such non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures on its website.\nI would now like to pass the call over to Earl.\nI'm happy to announce that for the quarter, Group one produced adjusted net income of $103 million.\nThis translates to adjusted earnings per share of $5.57 per diluted share, a 236% increase compared to the previous year and a 170% rise over the pre-pandemic first quarter of 2019.\nOur adjusted net income results exclude non-core items of $1.7 million in after-tax disaster pay given to employees who were unable to work during our February Texas store closures, partially offset by an $800,000 after-tax benefit from legal settlements and a $200,000 after-tax net gain on dealership and real estate transactions.\nThese profit outcomes were particularly remarkable considering that our Texas operations, which typically account for around 40% of our total revenues, were severely affected due to a record-breaking February winter weather event.\nOur stores effectively lost approximately the equivalent of a full week of business.\nIt is probable that vehicle sales were largely postponed to subsequent months, but the available service shop hours were permanently lost.\nAdditionally, the U.K. remained under lockdown throughout the entire first quarter.\nWith numerous restrictions in all our markets in 2020, it was challenging to generate revenue growth.\nThis improvement was driven by new and used vehicle revenue increases in the U.S., well exceeding 20% in the first quarter.\nNaturally, we should remember that the pandemic began to negatively impact traffic and sales during the second half of March last year.\nHowever, the crucial point is that consumer demand for vehicles in the U.S. remains exceptionally strong and reached an even higher level in March.\nIt is true that sales have been and will be hindered to some extent by low inventory levels.\nNevertheless, this continues to support above-average margin levels.\nDaryl will discuss our inventory situation in more detail shortly.\nOur aftersales business has suffered throughout the pandemic from reduced driving and various lockdown conditions in all our markets.\nSpecifically, our U.S. business began 2021 very slowly in January and February but surged in March.\nAgain, Daryl will provide more details, but this gives us great confidence that we will experience very strong parts and service business this spring and summer in both the U.S. and likely the U.K. as those facilities are now fully operational.\nIn the U.S., we are particularly pleased that our service results have now returned to pre-pandemic levels.\nOn a same-store basis, our U.S. total aftersales gross profit increased 3% compared to the first quarter of 2019, and customer-paid gross profit rose 14% over that same pre-pandemic period.\nThese are very encouraging indicators for continued aftersales improvement in 2021.\nDaryl will provide more information on our U.S. results momentarily.\nRegarding the U.K., mandatory lockdowns began on November 5, 2020, and persisted through the entire first quarter.\nThey have since been lifted as of April 12.\nSimilar to the United States, our United Kingdom business has predominantly moved to online sales through our Acceleride system, as our physical locations have been shut for five months.\nThough we lacked in-person sales teams and couldn't offer test drives, we managed to sell over 13,000 new and pre-owned vehicles in the quarter.\nThe scarcity of new vehicles boosted our same-store new vehicle profit margins by 160 basis points to 5.6% in Q1.\nOur aftermarket service profit margin rose by nearly 400 basis points to 58.4%, as most work at our dealerships involved major repairs, with customers postponing routine maintenance until after lockdown restrictions eased.\nThe combination of robust new vehicle and aftermarket service margins, along with strict cost management, as shown by an 1,800 basis point improvement in same-store SG&A compared to the previous year, allowed us to generate significant profit in the UK despite closed showrooms.\nSince we were allowed to reopen showrooms on April 12, we've witnessed very high levels of sales and service activity in our dealerships.\nThis gives us great optimism for our UK operations for the remainder of 2021.\nSeveral elements contributed to our exceptional US first quarter results, including growth in new and used vehicle sales, aftermarket services expansion, and ongoing strong cost control, all of which continue trends from the latter half of 2020.\nIn comparison to the pre-pandemic first quarter of 2019, our same-store new and used unit sales grew by 11% and 5%, respectively.\nThis 11% increase in new vehicle sales outperformed the retail industry average.\nUS new vehicle inventory levels ended the quarter at 14,500 units, representing a 34-day supply.\nWe expect inventories to remain limited and will continue to adapt our operations as needed.\nOur same-store used vehicle unit sales improved by 14% sequentially, along with a 5% increase over the first quarter of 2019.\nUsed vehicle inventories remain constrained as well.\nNevertheless, we've implemented several changes in our merchandising, sourcing, reconditioning, and acquisition processes that have resulted in higher turnover and better inventory management.\nAlthough we are near record-high monthly levels of 90 units sold per core location in the quarter, we still believe there is substantial opportunity for growth in used vehicle sales at our dealerships in the future.\nThe second and most encouraging profit driver was our aftermarket service performance.\nWarranty and collision repair sales were still very low in January and February, but we observed improvement in March.\nOur customer-paid business is very robust.\nAs Earl mentioned, our same-store customer-paid gross profit increased by 14% compared to the first quarter of 2019.\nThis allowed us to grow total aftermarket service gross profit by 3% compared to pre-pandemic levels, despite significant challenges in warranty and collision repair, both of which will recover over time.\nWe observed a substantial increase in gross profit per repair order in the quarter, offsetting declines in repair order volume.\nIn March, customer traffic increased and our same-store customer-paid repair order count grew 23% compared to March 2020.\nWe anticipate aftermarket services will continue to improve in the near future.\nThe third major factor driving our outstanding profit performance was continued cost discipline.\nOur first quarter adjusted SG&A as a percentage of gross profit was 63%, down from 74% in the pre-pandemic first quarter of 2019.\nPart of the decrease is certainly due to higher vehicle margins, which we don't believe will be fully permanent, but a significant portion of the improvement is due to productivity gains.\nFor instance, because of tools like Acceleride, our salespeople are more efficient.\nDue to our higher proportion of flat-rate technicians, our technicians are more productive.\nThese examples of permanent productivity improvements will allow for a significant ongoing reduction in our cost structure.\nI would like to provide another quarterly update on Acceleride, our digital retailing platform.\nWe maintained our upward trajectory in the first quarter by selling a record 4,000 vehicles through Acceleride, an increase of 124% over the previous year and 7% of total retail units sold.\nClients who opt for Acceleride continue to finalize deals at a significantly higher frequency compared to other channels.\nI'd like to inform you about several improvements we've implemented or will soon introduce to the Acceleride system.\nWe've now incorporated instant loan payoff estimates within the platform.\nWe've released an Android application to complement our existing iOS app.\nUsers can now switch between English and Spanish languages.\nIn addition to reserving vehicles with credit cards, customers can now process down payments of any amount directly through the application.\nIn the coming months, we'll introduce variable delivery fees integrated into the customer's experience.\nThis will present delivery charges earlier in the process and include them in monthly payment calculations based on the customer's delivery location.\nWe're developing numerous other upgrades and will provide updates as appropriate.\nWe consider our digital retail process unparalleled in the industry, and we're continuously enhancing it to maintain our leading position in this revolutionary technology.\nBriefly discussing Brazil.\nDespite a 7% drop in new vehicle industry sales due to limited inventory and additional COVID restrictions, our team excelled at increasing margins and aggressively reducing costs to achieve a remarkably strong quarterly profit during the typically weakest quarter of the year.\nWe easily broke the record for the most profitable first quarter in Group 1's eight-year ownership and are well-positioned to benefit from a sales recovery as the pandemic subsides.\nAs of March 31, we had $83 million in cash and an additional $245 million in our floorplan offset accounts, bringing total cash liquidity to $328 million.\nThere was also $283 million of additional borrowing capacity on our U.S. syndicated acquisition line, bringing total immediate liquidity to over $600 million.\nWe also generated $157 million in adjusted operating cash flow in the first quarter and $134 million in free cash flow after deducting capital expenditures.\nOur rent-adjusted leverage ratio, as defined by our U.S. syndicated credit facility, decreased to two times at the end of March, providing ample flexibility for capital deployment.\nOn a net basis, considering all U.S. cash on hand, our leverage was 1.6 times as of March 31.\nRegarding interest expenses.\nOur quarterly floorplan interest of $7.6 million decreased by $5.3 million or 41% compared to the first quarter of 2020.\nThis reduction was mainly due to lower inventory levels and related borrowings.\nNon-floorplan interest expense decreased by $4.3 million or 24% from the previous year, primarily due to last year's bond debt refinancing.\nAs a reminder, we continue to manage our interest risk conservatively.\nWe have floorplan swaps averaging $550 million in place through 2026.\nConsidering our mortgage swaps on bond debt, over 75% of our debt is at fixed rates.\nConsequently, a 100-basis point increase in interest rates would only have an approximate $0.20 negative impact on our annual earnings per share.\nOur balance sheet and liquidity position have never been stronger, and we look forward to expanding the company through mergers and acquisitions.\nWe are observing a strong flow of potential deals and expect to close or enter into contracts to acquire additional dealerships this year.\nRegarding our corporate development efforts, we previously announced the March acquisition of two Toyota franchises on Cape Cod, expanding our New England platform to 10 stores and adding $120 million in incremental annual revenues.\nWe also previously announced the January dispositions of the Cadillac franchise in the Dallas-Fort Worth market area and a Mini franchise in the El Paso market.\nWe've also completed the termination of the U.K. Ford franchise in March and the sale of a Mississippi Kia franchise in April.\nAs Daniel mentioned, we continue to prioritize external growth in our capital allocation process and are optimistic about beneficial opportunities as the year progresses.\nSummary: ",

robust results showcasing ongoing recovery and the durability of our business approach.\nRising vaccination rates and consumer expenditure, along with improving business conditions, continued to fuel strong travel demand throughout summer and into autumn.\nAs international borders open and travel conditions improve, we remain highly optimistic about people's eagerness to travel and interact more

mainly driven by strong leisure trends, with leisure room nights approximately equal to 2019 levels and leisure rates surpassing 2019 figures.\nBusiness travel continued to gain traction, with midweek occupancy and rates showing significant improvement compared to the second quarter.\nDuring the quarter, business transient room nights were approximately 75% of previous peak levels.\nGroup bookings still lagged but showed considerable sequential improvement from the second quarter, bolstered by strong social event bookings.\nFor the quarter, group RevPAR was about 60% of 2019 levels, a 21 percentage point improvement from the second quarter.\nOverall systemwide RevPAR compared to 2019 reached its highest point in July at 85%, with rates just below previous peaks.\nAs anticipated, recovery slowed slightly later in the quarter due to typical seasonality and changes in customer mix, but overall trends remained positive.\nBoth August and September RevPAR reached approximately 80% of 2019 levels, driven by continued strength in leisure and increases in business travel after Labor Day as offices and schools reopened.\nThese trends improved slightly into October, with month-to-date RevPAR at about 84% of 2019 levels and rates in the U.S. nearly back to previous peaks.\nApproximately 40% of systemwide hotels have surpassed 2019 RevPAR levels in October

about future travel demand.\nTSA reported third quarter travel numbers were nearly 80% of 2019 levels, with demand increasing further following announcements of the U.S. border reopening and the lifting of the international travel ban for vaccinated travelers.\nFurthermore, studies indicate that nearly 70% of U.S. businesses have resumed travel, an increase of 28 points from the end of the second quarter.\nWith approximately 80% of our typical corporate mix coming from small- and medium-sized businesses and the slower recovery of larger corporate travel, we've taken the opportunity to continue our pre-COVID efforts to further increase our focus on this demand segment.\nThis demand is higher-rated and more resilient, which has helped us recover more quickly in business transient and should drive rate compression in the future as larger corporate travel increases.\nRegarding group bookings, our position for the remainder of the year remains relatively stable, with forward booking sentiment improving as concerns about variants decrease.\nAdditionally, the recent reopenings of some of our large urban properties, such as the New York Hilton Midtown, have increased our confidence in our positioning as group travel recovers.\nWe added nearly 100 hotels and 15,000 rooms across all major regions and achieved strong net unit growth of 6.6% in the third quarter.\nConversions accounted for approximately one-third of openings.\nYear-to-date, we've added more than 42,000 net rooms globally, surpassing all our major branded competitors.\nOur performance demonstrates the success of our disciplined growth strategy, the strength of our brands, network effect, and commercial engines worldwide.\nIt also reflects our growing confidence in a strong recovery of global tourism in the coming months and years.\nDuring the quarter, we introduced our large-scale franchise model in China, allowing independent owners to explore franchising options with our Hilton Garden Inn brand using a prototype specifically designed for the Chinese market.\nWe have signed over 100 agreements to develop Hilton Garden properties in China, boosting our confidence in the long-term growth of our focused service brands and our ability to serve a growing middle class.\nFollowing our recently announced exclusive licensing agreement with Country Garden, we were excited to open our first Home2 Suites in China with plans to expand to more than 1,000 locations.\nWe are eager to utilize our partnership to meet the rapidly increasing demand for mid-scale hotels in China.\nWe also marked the opening of our 500th Home2 Suites just 10 years after the brand's launch, making it one of the industry's fastest-growing brands and boasting North America's largest pipeline with over 400 hotels in development.\nOur luxury and lifestyle presence continued to grow globally with the introduction of Canopy by Hilton in Spain and the highly anticipated opening of Mango House LXR in the Seychelles.\nLXR celebrated its debut in Asia Pacific with the opening of ROKU KYOTO, marking another significant milestone in its global expansion.\nIn the quarter, we signed agreements for nearly 24,000 rooms, an increase of about 40% year-over-year, driven by strong performance in the Americas and Asia Pacific regions.\nContributing to our positive momentum in luxury, we announced the signing of Conrad Los Angeles, the brand's first property in California.\nThe 300-room hotel is set to open in 2022 as part of The Grand LA mixed-use development.\nWith roughly 404,000 rooms in development, more than half of which are under construction, we anticipate positive development trends to continue, driven by both new construction and conversion opportunities.\nFor the full year, we project net unit growth between 5% and 5.5%, and we expect mid-single-digit growth to continue for the next several years.\nFor our guests, flexibility has always been important, but the pandemic has made choice and control even more essential.\nWe were pleased to introduce several new commercial programs and loyalty extensions, including the launch of Digital Key Share, a first for a major hospitality company.\nThis feature allows multiple guests to access their room's digital key.\nAdditional technological improvements have enabled our elite Honors members to begin enjoying automatic room upgrades.\nGold and Diamond members may receive notification of a complimentary upgrade before arrival, allowing guests to select their upgraded room directly using the Hilton Honors app.\nWe continue to explore new opportunities to further engage our 123 million Honors members and are delighted to see engagement is almost back to 2019 levels.\nDuring the quarter, membership increased by 11% year-over-year.\nHonors members accounted for 59% of occupancy, with the U.S. at 66%, just two percentage points below 2019 levels.\nDuring the pandemic, approximately 23 million U.S. households adopted a new pet, including my own.\nLike many others, my family enjoys traveling with our new dog, Miller.\nIn the coming months, Homewood Suites will join Home2 in becoming 100% pet-friendly in the U.S., with plans for all limited service brands to be pet-friendly by the first quarter of next year.\nOur guests are keen to travel with their furry companions.\nBy simplifying this process, we're able to attract new business and meet demand.\nAs the global travel environment improves, I continue to be impressed by our team members' commitment to providing exceptional experiences for our guests.\nThat's why I am particularly proud that last week we were ranked as the number three World's Best Workplace by Fortune and Great Place to Work.\nAfter six consecutive years of being ranked, Hilton was the only hospitality company on the list.\nWe firmly believe that Hilton continues to be a source of opportunity for all of our stakeholders worldwide and are very optimistic about the future.\nDuring the quarter, systemwide RevPAR grew 98.7% compared to the previous year on a comparable and currency-neutral basis as the recovery continued to gain momentum, driven by strong leisure demand, particularly in the U.S. and across Europe.\nThis performance was attributed to growth in both occupancy and rates.\nChris noted that systemwide RevPAR decreased by 18.8% in comparison to 2019.\nThe third quarter saw Adjusted EBITDA reach $519 million, representing a 132% increase from the previous year.\nThe outcomes reflect the overall improvement in travel demand.\nA 93% growth in management and franchise fees was driven by significant RevPAR improvements and Honors license fees.\nFurthermore, the results were positively impacted by ongoing cost management at both corporate and property levels.\nOur ownership portfolio exceeded expectations in the third quarter, propelled by the accelerating recovery in Europe, the Tokyo Olympics, and continued cost control measures.\nThe quarter's diluted earnings per share, adjusted for special items, amounted to $0.78.\nLet's examine our regional performance.\nComparable U.S. RevPAR in the third quarter increased by 105% year-over-year but was 14% lower than 2019.\nStrong performance in July was driven by robust leisure demand and improving business transient trends.\nLater in the quarter, trends slightly decelerated due to seasonal factors.\nThe U.S. maintained an average occupancy of nearly 70% for the quarter, with overall rates generally matching 2019 levels.\nIn the Americas outside the U.S., third quarter RevPAR rose by 168% year-over-year but was 30% below 2019 levels.\nThe region benefited from relaxed travel restrictions and strong leisure demand during the summer months.\nCanada experienced a notable increase in demand in August after opening their borders to vaccinated Americans.\nEurope saw RevPAR grow by 142% year-over-year, though it remained 35% below 2019 levels.\nTravel demand accelerated across the region in the third quarter as vaccination rates increased and international travel restrictions eased.\nThe Middle East and Africa region experienced a 110% increase in RevPAR year-over-year, but it was still 29% lower than 2019.\nPerformance was boosted by strong domestic leisure demand and international inbound travel from Europe.\nIn the Asia Pacific region, third quarter RevPAR grew by 5% year-over-year but was 41% lower than 2019.\nChina's RevPAR was 25% below 2019 levels due to reimposed restrictions and lockdowns across the country following a rise in COVID cases.\nChina has shown steady recovery into October, with occupancy approaching 60% for the month.\nIn the rest of the Asia Pacific region, extended lockdowns in Australia and New Zealand offset the positive impact of the Tokyo Olympics.\nAs Chris mentioned, we achieved a 6.6% net unit growth in the third quarter.\nOur pipeline expanded sequentially, reaching 404,000 rooms at the quarter's end, with 62% of pipeline rooms located outside the U.S. Development activity is gaining momentum globally as the recovery progresses, demonstrating the confidence owners and developers have in our strong commercial engines and industry-leading brands.\nFor the full year, we now anticipate signings to increase in the mid- to high teens range year-over-year and expect net unit growth of 5% to 5.5%.\nRegarding our balance sheet, we concluded the quarter with $8.9 billion in long-term debt and $1.4 billion in total cash and cash equivalents.\nWe take pride in the financial flexibility we've demonstrated over the past 18 months.\nLooking ahead, we remain confident in our balance sheet management as we progress through the recovery and move closer to our target leverage.\nWe would now like to open the line for any questions you may have.\n[Operator Instructions] Chad, can we have our first question, please?\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Jeff Jones, our President and CEO, and Tony Bowen, our CFO, are participating in today's conference call.\nWe will be discussing some figures today that are presented on a non-GAAP basis.\nThese statements are based on current information and management's expectations as of today, and do not guarantee future performance.\nConsequently, our actual outcomes and results may differ significantly.\nYou can find more information about these risks in our Form 10-K for fiscal 2020 and other SEC filings.\nWe request that participants restrict themselves to one question with a follow-up during Q&A, after which they may rejoin the queue.\nWe sincerely hope you and your loved ones are remaining safe and well during these unprecedented times.\nWe are deeply saddened by the continuing acts of racial injustice in our country that have tragically claimed lives.\nWe are dedicated to fostering a culture of inclusion at H&R Block and contributing to necessary change in our communities.\nI will begin by explaining our response since the pandemic's onset.\nI will then offer our perspective on the industry and our results, followed by our plans for executing the remainder of the tax season.\nNext, I will discuss Wave, including an exciting new product that was introduced to more small business owners last week.\nLastly, I will share our future outlook, and Tony will review our fiscal '20 results, capital allocation, and thoughts on fiscal '21.\nThe pandemic has presented business challenges unlike any we've encountered before.\nOur financial performance has been affected.\nWe have utilized our full line of credit and demonstrated flexibility and innovation by swiftly implementing significant changes to our operating model to continue serving clients.\nIn doing so, we have accelerated our efforts to transform H&R Block.\nOur purpose has never been more crucial as we assist consumers in accessing their much-needed refunds and support small business owners navigating financial uncertainty caused by the pandemic.\nIn mid-March, as the virus's spread began impacting our business, we promptly implemented our crisis management plan, enabling us to react effectively and efficiently to an extremely challenging situation.\nIn our retail locations, nearly every state implemented lockdown policies that affected our ability to operate and prevented people from leaving home to receive service in their preferred manner.\nAt the peak, almost 20% of our office network was closed to the public.\nFor offices that remained open, we made significant changes by limiting in-person service, requiring drop-off in nearly half the network, and increasing the use of our virtual capabilities.\nIn essence, our obligation to comply with local orders is subject to much greater scrutiny than local independent businesses.\nRegardless of our operational approach, one of our top priorities has been ensuring the health and safety of our associates, franchisees, and clients, while helping clients access their refunds.\nOur teams worked diligently to maintain clean offices, follow social distancing protocols, and comply with constantly changing city and state guidelines.\nDue to these changes, providing digital solutions to our clients became more crucial than ever.\nAs you may recall, our primary objective at the beginning of this year was to digitally enable every aspect of our business to deliver our expertise to consumers in innovative ways.\nThese efforts have been instrumental in allowing us to meet our clients' needs using methods we didn't have previously.\nWe have observed a significant increase in returns utilizing our digital capabilities, including Tax Pro Go, Tax Pro Review, and the Approve Online feature.\nApprove Online allows filers to review their returns, approve them, and pay their fees from their mobile devices.\nWith a substantial portion of our clients historically visiting offices multiple times to complete their returns, this capability offers tremendous convenience, especially during these uncertain times.\nWe also enhanced our digital capabilities for our tax professionals, as many of them couldn't serve clients from our offices.\nWithin two weeks, we established a work-from-home model, allowing thousands of tax professionals to prepare returns without coming into the office.\nThis capability will be invaluable moving forward.\nOur efforts during this crisis to continue meeting client needs, digitally enable our business, and serve clients according to their preferences have resulted in positive feedback, with service quality scores improving by 2 points in Assisted and 5 points in DIY, building on significant increases in both areas in fiscal '19.\nBeyond taking care of our clients, we also implemented significant measures to support our associates.\nOur tax professionals are our most valuable asset, and I'm proud of the investment we made to create a leading benefit program for our seasonal associates directly impacted by the situation.\nI'm also proud of our response and ongoing commitment to our communities.\nWe joined the American Express 'Stand for Small' coalition in support of small businesses.\nAt Wave, we provided instant payouts to all our payments customers for free, giving them immediate access to their money.\nWe also offered free tax preparation to frontline workers through Tax Pro Go in May and June, which received overwhelmingly positive feedback.\nWith this context on our operations, I'd like to briefly discuss what we're observing in the industry as a result of the pandemic, as well as our results.\nIndustry return volume has been unusual due to the filing extension and the stimulus package.\nThrough June 5, the IRS reported total filings down 6%.\nThe IRS's volume includes millions of returns completed by those who typically don't file.\nThey did so this year to receive stimulus payments.\nWe believe the vast majority of these returns were completed through the IRS's fillable form site, which is inflating the number of DIY returns in the market.\nDIY electronic tax filings have decreased by about 4%, while assisted filings have dropped 15% as of June 5, not including certain returns.\nWe anticipate this difference will lessen as tax season concludes and will provide more information during our Q1 earnings call.\nOur market share in DIY filings has remained steady through early June.\nFor assisted filings, we gained market share through April's end, but this trend is slowing during the extended filing period.\nIt's crucial to note that such an extension is unprecedented in U.S. history, making it difficult to predict consumer behavior.\nAlthough states are beginning to lift restrictions, normal business operations have not resumed.\nWe have more offices open and extended hours compared to a typical first quarter, but many locations are not serving clients in person.\nWe continue to assist clients virtually or through drop-off services.\nWhile we have more tax professionals working than usual for this time of year, it's significantly fewer than during a normal April tax season.\nThese factors may affect client volumes.\nWe've adjusted our marketing strategies for the quarter to inform consumers about our availability and various drop-off and digital options.\nWe're using multiple channels to target those who haven't filed yet.\nIn addition to assisting consumers, we're also supporting small business owners during these challenging times.\nWe've created a free Small Business Resource Center on our website to provide updates on government assistance programs.\nIn May, we introduced our recovery action plan service to help entrepreneurs navigate the CARES Act, including loan programs and tax credits.\nThis showcases our advantage in providing human expertise.\nRegarding Wave, after strong revenue growth exceeding 40% through mid-March, we've seen flat revenues in April and May due to the pandemic's impact on small businesses.\nWe've taken steps to limit Wave's operating losses while maintaining key investments in the business.\nDespite these measures, we expect the near-term performance and valuation of Wave to be negatively impacted, similar to many businesses during this pandemic.\nConsequently, we've recorded a non-cash impairment of goodwill, which Tony will discuss later.\nAlthough there's been a short-term impact, we remain optimistic about Wave's long-term viability and future growth.\nOne reason for this confidence is Wave's innovation and upcoming products and services.\nA prime example is Wave Money, which was recently expanded to more customers.\nWave Money is a unique business bank account that automatically manages all aspects of bookkeeping, allowing entrepreneurs to focus on their business.\nThis first-to-market, software-powered small business bank account offers several benefits to Wave customers, including no monthly fees or minimums, seamless integration with Wave's accounting platform for expense categorization and tax preparation, and instant access to funds via Wave payments.\nWe're excited about this product as we continue to innovate to simplify small business owners' lives.\nIn conclusion, as we adapt to this new normal, we remain focused on our achievements this year and the significant progress we've made towards our strategic goals in unexpected ways.\nWe're taking this opportunity to thoroughly evaluate our progress, identify areas for improvement, and reinforce our sense of urgency in these efforts.\nWe remain committed to transforming our business.\nWe're currently evaluating and reprioritizing our strategic imperatives while examining our expense structure to identify potential savings to fund future initiatives.\nThis work is ongoing and will remain flexible given our current operating environment.\nWe'll provide more details later this year.\nI'll now hand the call over to Tony.\nDuring our last conversation, we were on track to meet our tax season and fiscal year outlook.\nHowever, like many companies, the pandemic has negatively impacted our business and financial performance.\nDue to the pandemic's timing coinciding with the period in our fiscal year when we recognize most of our revenue, we withdrew our fiscal year 2020 financial outlook.\nAs such, I won't be comparing our performance against those expectations as I normally would.\nInstead, I'll provide insights into our fiscal year 2020 financial results, how we anticipate the remainder of the tax season will impact our fiscal year 2021 financial performance, and the actions we're taking to enable continued investment for future growth.\nIn fiscal year 2020, we recorded revenues of $2.6 billion, representing a 14.7% decrease from the previous year, primarily due to lower tax return volumes resulting from the extended federal tax filing deadline, partially offset by Wave's contribution.\nRegarding expenses, total operating expenses increased by 3.4%, driven entirely by Wave's goodwill impairment and operating expenses.\nExcluding Wave, our total operating expenses would have decreased, though at a lower percentage than the revenue decline due to legal fees, COVID-19 related benefits, and planned technology investments.\nWe recorded a $106 million non-cash goodwill impairment for Wave due to the pandemic's impact on small businesses.\nAs Jeff mentioned, we've been pleased with Wave's performance since acquisition, with solid growth through mid-March.\nHowever, revenue growth has slowed during the pandemic, affecting small businesses' invoicing and payment volumes.\nWe remain confident in Wave's future and our ability to continue providing significant value to small business owners through Wave's innovative platform.\nRegarding the rest of the income statement, interest expense increased by $9 million.\nAbout 50% of this rise was attributed to increased usage of our credit line during regular business operations through our third fiscal quarter, while the remaining 50% was due to extra interest related to the $2 billion withdrawal in late March.\nThe fluctuations in income and expenditures led to a $3 million pre-tax deficit from ongoing operations.\nThe GAAP earnings per share was a positive $0.03 owing to beneficial discrete tax items.\nThe adjusted earnings per share, which does not include the effect of impairment and amortization of intangibles related to Wave and tax office acquisitions, amounted to $0.84.\nNo alterations were made to accrued contingent liabilities associated with Sand Canyon in discontinued operations throughout the year.\nI will now address capital allocation and the balance sheet.\nDespite the unique challenges posed by COVID-19, our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged.\nThe primary focus is maintaining sufficient liquidity for our operational requirements.\nOur current liquidity status remains robust, concluding the year with $2.7 billion in cash, which includes the entire $2 billion drawn from our credit line.\nAs announced in late March, we believe we have adequate funds to support operations at the beginning of the 2021 tax season.\nOur credit line is subject to various conditions, including a covenant requiring us to maintain a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 3.5 times on April 30.\nBased on our fiscal year 2020 financial results, we did not meet this covenant, but we have obtained a waiver from our lenders without any changes to our credit line terms.\nAfter ensuring adequate liquidity, we make strategic investments back into the business that we believe will foster sustainable growth, ultimately benefiting our shareholders.\nAs Jeff mentioned, given the pandemic's impact on our business, we have initiated a review of our expense structure to eliminate unnecessary spending while continuing to fund initiatives that will drive future growth.\nI will discuss these expense measures shortly.\nThe final step in our capital allocation process involves distributing excess capital through quarterly dividends and share repurchases.\nI'm pleased to announce that despite the financial impact of COVID-19 and the extended tax season, our Board of Directors has declared a $0.26 per share dividend payable on July 1.\nWe have consistently paid dividends since going public in 1962.\nWe remain committed to conducting an annual review of the dividend after each fiscal year.\nRegarding share repurchases, in fiscal 2020, we bought back a total of 10.1 million shares for $247 million at an average price of $24.36.\nWe did not repurchase any shares in the fourth quarter.\nFor the past two years, we have committed to, at minimum, repurchasing shares to offset dilution from equity grants and making opportunistic share repurchases thereafter.\nGiven the uncertainty created by COVID-19, we have not yet determined our share repurchase approach for fiscal 2021.\nI will now discuss our thoughts regarding fiscal 2021.\nAs a reminder, last year we provided our fiscal year financial outlook on our Q4 call.\nSince we haven't yet completed the current tax season and uncertainty remains due to the pandemic, we will not be providing a financial outlook at this time.\nInstead, we plan to provide a tax season recap on our first quarter call in September and our full financial outlook for fiscal 2021 on our second quarter call in December.\nLet me share some general thoughts on how we expect to conclude the tax season and our efforts to mitigate cost increases resulting from the extension.\nFirst, while it's natural to expect all volume lost in Q4 of fiscal 2020 to shift into the first quarter of fiscal 2021, that may not necessarily be the case.\nAs Jeff mentioned, during this quarter, we are still operating under a modified model.\nAlthough we have more offices open than usual, we are still operating with just half of our total network and a substantial portion unable to serve clients face-to-face.\nThis may affect our ability to retain clients and attract new ones to the brand.\nRegarding expenses, due to the extension of the tax season, we anticipate additional costs during the first quarter.\nWe expect an increase of approximately $10 million in marketing expense and about $10 million in interest expense.\nAdditionally, we expect variable expenses related to compensation, benefits, and bad debt to be approximately 40% of incremental Assisted revenues generated.\nWe are actively exploring ways to mitigate any additional costs by closely examining all spending categories and making prudent reductions across our business.\nWe're still finalizing these plans, but I can highlight a few areas of focus, including renegotiating rents with landlords across our retail footprint, implementing a hiring freeze, eliminating merit increases for fiscal 2021, examining vendor spend to renegotiate existing contracts, and reducing capital expenditures to only what is necessary.\nIn addition to these savings, we have entered into a non-binding letter of intent with MetaBank to be the provider of our financial products, including Refund Transfer, Refund Advance, Emerald Advance, and Emerald Card, which will result in savings.\nMetaBank is a leader in providing financial solutions to consumers and has significant experience in the tax preparation industry.\nWe're excited to partner with them to continue offering valuable products to our clients.\nIn conclusion, we've taken prudent steps to adjust to the pandemic, including our modified operating model, line of credit draw, and cost reduction efforts.\nThese measures will allow us to operate effectively while enabling continued investments in our future.\nWe've faced unprecedented challenges during the last few months.\nThe resilience and dedication of our team, our strong financial foundation, and our ability to adjust our operating model has enabled us to continue delivering tremendous value to our clients when they need us most.\nI am confident we'll emerge from this crisis stronger than ever as we continue the work to transform our business.\nI look forward to speaking with you in September.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:You may start, Neil.\nAsh will provide additional information about our recent fundraising efforts, the newly modified credit agreement, and our portfolio's performance so far this year and in the first quarter.\nThe fourth quarter's end marks the most difficult year in Hersha's existence.\nOur dedicated team members, many present in our offices today, allowed us to remain adaptable, make wise choices, and implement various strategies to ensure financial stability for the foreseeable future.\nJay, Ash, and I are proud to represent our team as we share some positive news today.\nWe enter 2021 with a positive outlook on recovery as vaccine distribution gains traction and more individuals choose to travel.\nThe year began stronger than expected for our portfolio, with RevPAR exceeding $60, as South Florida and Washington DC compensated for restrictions on the West Coast and in the Northeast.\nWe achieved our first month of positive hotel-level EBITDA in January and are encouraged by February's performance thus far.\nBookings for President's Day weekend across the portfolio were the highest since the pandemic began a year ago.\nWe believe that leisure demand, supported by ongoing government stimulus, will lead the recovery, but with significantly more pent-up demand than was realized last summer.\nWe are also optimistic based on airline data.\nThe majority of corporate accounts expect to return to at least half of pre-COVID travel levels by the end of 2021, with over 40% anticipating a full recovery in corporate travel by 2022.\nWhile leisure travel will initiate this year's recovery, the industry should experience significant acceleration with the return of business travel, potentially beginning as early as the second quarter and increasing throughout the latter half of the year.\nDrive-to resorts have been our top performers since the pandemic's onset.\nThis hotel portfolio, representing about 25% of our pre-pandemic EBITDA, achieved a weighted average occupancy approaching 40% and realized 2% ADR growth for the full year 2020.\nGovernment-mandated closures in California affected our coastal properties' performance in December and January, but we're seeing immediate improvements in February with the lifting of these restrictions.\nWe're not only seeing leisure travelers return but also early signs of business and small group activity.\nNew corporate accounts for upcoming projects and deposits for spring and fall weddings are building a foundation at the Sanctuary Beach Resort and Hotel Milo.\nOn the other side of the country in Key West, the Parrot Key Hotel and Villas was our top-performing asset during the fourth quarter, achieving 55% occupancy and 8.4% year-over-year ADR growth to $306 for the period.\nThe holiday weeks were particularly strong, especially the period between Christmas and New Year's, which saw occupancy exceed 90% and ADR surpass 2019 levels at the hotel.\nWe anticipate several strong quarters ahead at this exceptionally positioned resort.\nOur largest property, the Cadillac Hotel and Beach Club on Miami Beach, is experiencing increased demand on weekends and during special events, generating occupancies approaching 90% with rates expected to improve incrementally throughout the rest of the quarter.\nMomentum has been building in Miami since the start of the year due to leisure demand, and recent announcements about major corporate relocations highlight the region's tremendous appeal, making us optimistic about this year's recovery and substantial market growth in the coming years.\nUrban destinations were essentially closed from March to September last year and again from November through January.\nWe anticipate that the reopening of museums, national parks, theaters, sports venues, and more bars and restaurants in the coming months will lead to an increase in both pent-up leisure and business demand in our major cities.\nAs travel resumes, which we've already observed in warmer climates like South Florida and even at our lifestyle hotels up north over President's Day weekend, our diverse portfolio provides us multiple opportunities to capture market share while maintaining cost-efficient operations as occupancy builds towards normalization.\nWashington DC has been a very strong performing market, despite significantly reduced inauguration activities.\nAlthough the public couldn't attend the event, the St Gregory Hotel contracted with media outlets including CBS, BBC, and Al Jazeera.\nThe Hilton Garden Inn, M Street, and the Hampton Inn Mason accommodated the National Guard members deployed to the city leading up to and during the event.\nThe Ritz Carlton Georgetown maintained a $1,000 ADR for peak nights for the few leisure guests in town.\nWashington has started 2021 strongly, ending January with portfolio revenues more than double our initial expectations for the month.\nThe new presidential administration is expected to lead to increased activity among lobbying, federal government, and diplomatic segments, and we're also looking forward to the upcoming Cherry Blossom Festival in the coming quarter.\nOne of our better-performing markets during the fourth quarter, from a forecast perspective, was our New York City portfolio, finishing the quarter with nearly 40% occupancy, despite few leisure-oriented attractions being open in the city.\nWe continue to see strong performance from our JFK submarket, but also saw an increase in first responder business at our Brooklyn and lower Manhattan properties.\nThese customers, including the New York Fire and Police Departments and some medical groups, continue to use the nu hotel Brooklyn and the Hampton Inn Seaport, resulting in January occupancies of 97% and 51% respectively.\nAlthough this business is temporary and related to the ongoing COVID-19 spread, we're grateful that these frontline workers can use our hotels to stay safe and guide us through the final stretch of this pandemic.\nUrban market recovery is driven not only by vaccine distribution and the return of business and international travel but also significantly enhanced by reductions or deterioration of supply.\nIn markets across the country, aging hotels are becoming obsolete, such as the Wardman Park in D.C., the Embassy Suites in Philadelphia, and the Buckminster in Boston.\nNew York, more than anywhere else, has seen consultants forecast a range of figures regarding permanent supply reduction.\nWhile it may not reach as high as 25% as some have predicted, the confirmed closures in 2020 alone provide concrete evidence that the supply will contract.\nAdding to this is the newly announced proposal by the Department of Planning requiring special permits for new hotels and expansions in zoning districts throughout the city.\nPublic meetings have begun to discuss this proposal, which, if approved, will significantly affect hotel development across all five boroughs and provide substantial benefits to hotel owners for years to come.\nI'd like to discuss our capital allocation strategy and additional sources of liquidity before Ash delves into our balance sheet and burn rates.\nAs mentioned in previous earnings calls, we determined that selling assets was the most cost-effective way to raise funds and improve our financial flexibility.\nWe initiated extensive marketing campaigns with multiple brokers starting in the fall.\nOur prime locations in major gateway markets generated significant interest from private equity firms, family offices, and residential developers.\nThese hotels were fee-simple properties that remained operational throughout the pandemic, free from management and restrictive labor agreements, and many were unbranded, leading to a highly competitive bidding process.\nWe aim to generate between $150 million and $200 million from asset sales to reduce our senior credit facility debt.\nThe six recently announced asset sales will yield net proceeds of about $191 million.\nThe Sheraton Wilmington was sold in December, and the Courtyard San Diego transaction was completed last week.\nThe sales of the residences in Coconut Grove, Capitol Hill Hotel Washington, and Holiday Inn Express Cambridge are expected to finalize by the end of the first quarter, while the Duane Street Hotel sale should close in early Q2.\nMany of these hotels had significant upcoming capital projects, and their successful sale will reduce our capital expenditure budget by approximately $20 million in the coming years.\nAs part of a long-term strategy to recycle capital, these sales provide liquidity and flexibility at a reasonable cost.\nWe sold at a discount compared to pre-COVID values, but focused on mature properties we've owned for nearly a decade, hotels requiring additional investment during recovery, and the slowest-growing hotels in each of our geographic clusters.\nThe successful sale of these properties slightly improves the absolute RevPAR and EBITDA per key of the remaining portfolio, while significantly enhancing overall quality, EBITDA growth rate, and reducing capital expenditure and disruption at these assets during the recovery.\nWe were pleased to announce and fund a strategic financial agreement with Goldman Sachs Merchant Bank affiliates, providing a $150 million unsecured term loan, expandable to $200 million.\nThis capital injection, combined with asset sales, led to the successful amendment of our credit facility, extending our covenant waiver until June 2022 and eliminating term loan maturities in 2021.\nWe're glad to have cleared the path and provided financial flexibility to focus on our portfolio's recovery in the coming year.\nAs discussed in previous calls and investor meetings, we've maintained a consistent approach to capital allocation.\nConsidering our assets' cash flow profile and liquidity, and the upcoming recovery in travel and lodging, we were reluctant to pursue a transaction that would unnecessarily dilute shareholders or limit our future strategic options.\nWe conducted a comprehensive process for this capital raise.\nWe were impressed by the number and quality of investors interested in financing our portfolio and look forward to future collaborations with many of them.\nUltimately, Goldman Merchant Bank offered prepayment flexibility, draw and pick features, and importantly, the potential for future partnership in the coming cycle.\nAs we approach the end of the crisis and move into recovery, we remain optimistic about our portfolio's position in our operating markets, which include innovation-oriented urban gateway markets and nearby regional resorts.\nThe appeal of drive-to resorts for all traveler segments was evident in 2020, and we believe this trend will persist, but we remind investors that innovation markets performed strongly before the pandemic and have the most to recover with vaccine rollout.\nSince the pandemic began, Facebook and Google have expanded office space near our hotels on Manhattan's West side, and our Tribeca, Union Square, and Midtown East hotels will all benefit from major new office developments opening in the coming years.\nAmazon has announced the addition of 3,000 jobs in the Boston Seaport, within walking distance of our Envoy Hotel.\nOur Courtyard LA is well-positioned in Culver City for the growing tech and studio-related office expansion.\nPhiladelphia has attracted several new life science and pharma companies to state-of-the-art downtown spaces.\nEven our Miami locations are attracting new Class A office space in Coconut Grove and Miami Beach, with increasing interest from Northeastern asset management firms and West Coast technology companies.\nAll of this demonstrates that corporate expansion remains strong and will contribute to the already robust demand generators in our gateway markets, particularly in our carefully selected submarkets and locations.\nOur recent disposition announcements highlight the high quality of our portfolio.\nOur hotels are exactly the type that sophisticated investors seek.\nThey have high absolute RevPAR while still producing industry-leading margins.\nThe properties are relatively new and designed for today's traveler, with minimal capital expenditure requirements in the near future.\nOur hotels are fee simple with prepayable financing and few management or brand restrictions, all located in the most valuable markets in the United States.\nOur portfolio has proven attractive to a wide range of buyers and still offers significant operational and financial leverage for this recovery.\nWith increased financial flexibility from our capital infusion and no near-term constraints following our credit facility amendment, we can focus on gaining market share and operating our hotels efficiently to drive cash flow.\nAs Neil mentioned, I'll provide a more detailed analysis of our recently announced capital transactions, bank amendment, and their impact on our balance sheet and interest expense before concluding with an update on our operating results and current outlook.\nLast week, we announced a strategic financing agreement with Goldman Sachs Merchant Bank affiliates to provide $150 million in unsecured notes, which can be increased to $200 million at any time on or before September 30th of this year, with a maturity date in February 2026.\nWe successfully closed this financing yesterday and look forward to strengthening our partnership with Goldman Sachs Merchant Bank.\nWhen we initiated our capital raising process earlier this year to secure additional liquidity and flexibility, we prioritized two factors: non-dilutive capital and significant prepayment flexibility. This tailored solution met both of these key criteria and several others we had prioritized.\nThis funding is unsecured, subordinate to our bank facility, and permits deferring cash interest on half our financing for the first year, yielding significant short-term cash savings and extending our financial runway during recovery.\nThe capital doesn't restrict additional junior funding and allows more unsecured debt as long as we meet certain financial criteria.\nThese unsecured notes don't impose any additional limitations on our business operations or potential strategic partnerships.\nRecently, we announced agreements to sell two more hotels, bringing our total asset dispositions for the year to $178.5 million.\nThe completion of these sales, along with the Sheraton Wilmington and anticipated Duane Street Hotel sale, will generate $216 million in total proceeds. After repaying a $25 million mortgage on the Capitol Hill Hotel, net proceeds will be about $191 million, which we'll use with our unsecured note proceeds to clear our 2021 term loan and reduce overall debt by roughly $150 million.\nThe debt reduction and payment structure of our unsecured notes are expected to reduce our cash interest expense by about $4 million in 2021, while our total interest expense, including deferred interest from the notes, should remain similar to 2020 levels.\nWe finalized these property sales and unsecured note placement simultaneously with amending our revolving credit facility, and we're grateful for the ongoing support from our group of over 15 bank partners.\nThe amendment eliminates all term loan due dates until August 2022 and prolongs our covenant-waiver period, with our next financial covenant evaluation occurring on June 30, 2022.\nThe initial test will be based on the annualized second quarter performance, with the third quarter test annualizing the second and third quarter results, and so forth.\nThe amendment allows us to clear our preferred dividend backlog and maintain quarterly preferred dividend payments going forward.\nWe expect to clear the accrued preferred dividends by the end of the first quarter.\nFinalizing these financial transactions enables us to concentrate on our operational performance and advantageous opportunities that may arise during the recovery.\nOur properties have shown gradual improvement over the last six weeks, confirming our break-even projections for January. In this traditionally slow month, our properties achieved positive property-level cash flow with 40% occupancy and RevPAR levels 60% below January 2020.\nIn January, 20 of our 36 operational hotels reached break-even on the GOP line, with 14 achieving EBITDA break-even. This represents a 75% increase and 40% increase in properties breaking even on the EBITDA line compared to November and December, respectively.\nBased on January's performance and our Q1 forecast, we're confident in our previous estimates that the entire portfolio breaks even at the property level with GOP at a 60% RevPAR decline. At the corporate level, our RevPAR break-even occurs at a 40% decline.\nOur franchise operating model allows us to run our hotels with minimal staff until increased demand justifies additional hiring.\nWe employ various cost-cutting strategies like cross-utilizing management personnel, outsourcing, and job-sharing within hotels and across clusters to reduce overall expenses.\nThis model provides flexibility to maintain current staffing levels at our break-even occupancies of around 30% up to 55-60% at some properties.\nAs occupancy increases at our hotels, we're seeing GOP flow-throughs as high as 70%, and we expect to maintain these levels for the rest of the year as we boost both rate and occupancy.\nThe model's flexibility and resulting cost efficiencies justified continuing operations at our urban independent resort destinations throughout the pandemic, minimizing cash burn in 2020.\nOur total property-level cash burn for Q4 was $5.9 million, and in January, properties generated positive cash flow for the first time since March 2020.\nCorporate cash burn of $4.3 million in January represents a 60% reduction compared to April 2020, at the height of the crisis.\nWe anticipate February performance to match January, with March results expected to surpass both as vaccination distribution accelerates, government restrictions ease, spring break travel increases, and warmer weather in the Northeast should boost bookings across the portfolio.\nRegarding our New York City joint venture with Cindat Capital Management, following our 2016 transaction where we sold most of the portfolio for a $213 million gain, we maintained a subordinated minority interest. Recently, the equity interests were transferred, and we no longer have any equity interests or economic or legal commitments to the venture.\nWe've removed these seven hotels from our portfolio count, and they won't be included in our operating results after Q1.\nWe concluded Q4 with $23.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and deposits.\nDuring the quarter, we received $8.1 million in business interruption proceeds related to Hurricane Irma's impact on our South Florida portfolio, positively affecting our Q4 AFFO performance.\nWe invested $4.3 million in capital projects last quarter, bringing our 2020 total to $26 million, about $15 million below our initial forecast.\nOur 2021 capital expenditure will primarily focus on maintenance and life safety renovations, expected to be roughly 35% less than our 2020 spending.\nWith minimal future capital expenditure needs after investing $200 million since 2017 and recently divesting lower-growth, higher-cost hotels, our portfolio will experience little disruption or capital spending in the coming years.\nThe unsecured note facility from Goldman Sachs Merchant Bank, combined with announced asset sales, will be used to reduce leverage, provide liquidity, and clear the accrual on our preferred dividends.\nThese actions have extended our weighted average debt maturity to 3.6 years, with over 88% of our debt now either fixed or swapped.\nOver the past year, we've taken aggressive action to minimize operational losses.\nWe successfully implemented zero-based budgeting at our hotels, allowing for margin improvement well into the recovery.\nWe've reopened all our wholly-owned hotels and progressively reduced our cash burn rate to its lowest level since the pandemic began, demonstrating our effective asset management and adaptable franchise operating model.\nFollowing recent strategic transactions, we've optimized our balance sheet and shifted our focus to the portfolio's operational performance as demand resurfaces and profitable opportunities emerge during the recovery.\nWe're now ready to take your questions.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:We trust you are all doing well.\nWe will also mention certain non-GAAP metrics.\nWe think these metrics offer valuable supplementary information that, while not replacing GAAP measures, allows for greater clarity in reviewing our financial and operational results.\nI'm now pleased to hand things over to Philippe Krakowsky.\nI'll begin with a broad overview of our performance this quarter.\nEllen will then provide more details.\nI'll then wrap up by highlighting developments at our agencies, followed by a Q&A session.\nFirst and foremost, as Jerry mentioned, I hope you and your loved ones are staying healthy.\nAs we're all aware, the pandemic continues to significantly affect many parts of the world.\nGiven the circumstances, it's worth noting that our staff continue to deal with numerous personal and professional challenges posed by the health crisis.\nTheir remarkable resilience, innovative spirit, care for each other, and dedication to our clients are truly inspiring.\nDespite ongoing difficult business conditions, our people have driven the solid growth and high profitability we're reporting for the first quarter today.\nRegarding those results, starting with revenue, we're pleased with how we've begun the year.\nOrganic net revenue growth for the first quarter was 1.9%.\nThis reflects solid performance in the U.S., with a slight organic decrease of 20 basis points, and strong international growth of 6.3%, with increases across all global regions.\nIn the U.S., remember we're comparing to very strong underlying performance in Q1 2020, when we faced nearly 4% headwinds due to certain previously identified client losses from 2019.\nDomestically, this year's first quarter saw increases in areas like media, data services and technology, and our healthcare specialist agencies.\nOur international performance was led by 12.4% growth in Continental Europe, where we had a strong start to the year in our media, data and tech offerings as well as McCann Worldgroup.\nGlobally, our healthcare and retail client sectors, which consistently outperformed last year, were again our top growth drivers in Q1.\nFrom an operating segment perspective, our IAN segment grew 3.2% organically, led by media, data and technology and the healthcare specialty agencies.\nAs expected, compared to last year's largely pre-pandemic first quarter, global conditions in Q1 continued to most heavily impact events and sports marketing disciplines and certain project-driven businesses in both IAN and DXTRA.\nNevertheless, while the environment understandably remained quite cautious across our offerings and client sectors, the low points were generally not as severe.\nClients are finding their footing in a global economy increasingly showing signs of recovery.\nAs a brighter future comes into view, conversations with clients have generally become more positive and constructive.\nRegarding operating expenses and profitability, our teams once again demonstrated outstanding discipline.\nGiven 2020's uncertainty, we made decisions and took necessary actions throughout the year, though often difficult, to ensure the long-term health of the overall business.\nOur Q1 expenses reflect many benefits from the strategic restructuring executed last year, most notably in our base payroll and occupancy expenses.\nWe remain highly confident that over time, we're well-positioned to realize the full $160 million in annualized permanent operating expense savings we've previously discussed.\nAlong with returned growth and restructuring benefits, our Q1 results were further aided by variable expense categories remaining very low, as many activities are still restricted by the pandemic.\nThese include significantly reduced expenses for business travel, meetings, and associated costs.\nOur Q1 net income as reported was $92 million, including certain non-operating expenses.\nOur adjusted EBITA was $266 million, about 2.5 times recent years' first quarters.\nOur adjusted EBITA margin was 13.1%.\nDiluted earnings per share was $0.23 as reported and $0.45 as adjusted, mainly for our loss on early debt extinguishment, disposition of certain small non-strategic agencies, and amortization of acquired intangibles.\nWe refinanced some outstanding debt on very favorable terms this quarter, while extending our debt maturity profile.\nThis financial flexibility positions us well for potential volatility as the global economy recovers.\nWe're pleased to share these strong results, building on our company's long-term record of industry outperformance and consistent margin expansion.\nIt's worth noting that we continue investing in our people and capabilities, further differentiating our offerings in areas of strongest opportunity and growth.\nThis has been particularly relevant as we see growing client demand for technology and data services amid accelerating transformational change in marketing and media.\nOur ability to create marketing and media solutions combining creativity, technology and data to address higher-order client opportunities drove Q1 growth.\nGiven the complex media and consumer landscape, marketers seek partners who can help build their businesses through more precise, personalized and accountable individual engagements.\nWith third-party cookies being phased out, all businesses increasingly focus on leveraging first-party data value and finding partners to pool data assets.\nImportantly, this must be done respecting privacy and anticipating likely regulatory developments.\nWe remain well-positioned to benefit from these opportunities.\nOf course, Q1 is seasonally our smallest, and most of the year lies ahead.\nWe also recognize the heightened business uncertainty facing all companies, which translates to more challenging full-year visibility for a business like ours.\nConsequently, we're staying very close to our people and clients, requesting frequent financial updates from our teams, and continuing to carefully manage expenses.\nTo date, we're seeing cautious optimism from clients, and the business tone has improved in recent months.\nReopenings, fiscal stimulus, and vaccination programs in several of our largest markets are noticeably boosting economic activity and marketing demand.\nAs mentioned on our last call, we remain confident in areas we can control, namely our offerings' strength and competitiveness, and the talent within our group.\nWe're seeing increased client and prospect receptivity to our most contemporary services.\nGiven our strong start and assuming reasonably steady public health and global economic recovery, we believe we can deliver 5-6% full-year organic growth.\nAt that growth level, we'd expect to achieve 2021 adjusted EBITA margin of approximately 15.5%.\nWe view this as another year of strong value creation for all stakeholders.\nWe'll keep you updated on our progress throughout the year.\nWith that, I'll hand over to Ellen for a more detailed look at our results.\nI hope everyone is safe and well.\nI'd like to join Philippe in recognizing and admiring our people's tremendous accomplishments under very challenging circumstances.\nFirst quarter adjusted EBITDA, before a small restructuring adjustment, was $265.9 million with a 13.1% margin.\nThese levels compare very favorably to any previous first quarter.\nWe returned to growth with variable expenses lagging revenue recovery, and we're also seeing structural benefits from last year's restructuring program.\nDiluted earnings per share was $0.23 as reported and $0.45 as adjusted.\nThe adjustments exclude after-tax impacts of acquired intangibles amortization, a small restructuring refinement, non-operating losses on sales of certain small non-strategic businesses, and the non-operating loss on early debt extinguishment.\nWe refinanced $1 billion of senior notes scheduled to mature in coming years this quarter.\nWe placed $1 billion in new notes maturing in 10- and 20-year tranches.\nThe mid-February timing of these transactions was favorable given subsequent market rate increases.\nWe appreciate the support and reception we received.\nAs you may have seen in late March, we also received outlook upgrades from both S&P and Fitch.\nTurning to slide three, you'll see our Q1 P&L.\nI'll cover revenue and operating expenses in detail in the following slides.\nMoving to Q1 revenue on slide four.\nOur Q1 net revenue was $2.03 billion, a $55.6 million increase.\nCompared to Q1 2020, exchange rate changes had a positive 1.5% impact, with the dollar weaker against most of our

non-GAAP metrics as well.\nWe think these metrics provide useful additional information that, while not replacing GAAP measures, allows for greater clarity in reviewing our financial and operational performance.\nI'm now pleased to hand things over to Philippe Krakowsky.\nI'll begin with a high-level overview of our quarterly performance.\nEllen will then provide more details, and I'll wrap up with updates on key agency developments before we move to Q&A.\nThese include transitioning to remote work, and now planning office returns in many regions, as well as the significant personal challenges posed by the prolonged pandemic.\nIt's thanks to our people's efforts, dedication to their craft, clients and each other that we can share these very strong results today.\nThis performance demonstrates our resilience, represents a remarkable recovery from the pandemic's impact, and is also our largest second quarter ever.\nOur strong quarterly results build on IPG's consistent track record of outperforming the industry and expanding margins.\nOur growth across regions, disciplines and client sectors reflects more than just a rebounding global economy.\nIt highlights the increased value that marketing and media partners can deliver through integrating creativity, technology and data at scale, enabled by significantly accelerated digital transformation.\nAt Interpublic, we're confident we understand the powerful trends transforming consumer behavior and required for business relevance.\nWe are increasingly providing differentiated, higher-end solutions that help our clients succeed in a world of accelerated technological and societal change.\nThis requires creativity and precision, data and accountability, all of which we can combine in customized teams drawing talent from across our portfolio.\nUltimately, our growth demonstrates our ability to drive outstanding business results for clients.\nOur net organic revenue growth in Q2 was 19.8%.\nThis compares to Q2 2020 when our organic change was -9.9%, which, while well ahead of peers, marked our steepest decline of the recession.\nIt's also important to note our 7.9% organic increase this quarter compared to pre-pandemic Q2 2019.\nVersus last year, we saw double-digit organic growth rates globally.\nUS growth was 17.4%, while international markets ranged from 14% in Asia-Pacific to 49% in Latin America.\nWe also had broad contributions across operating segments and disciplines.\nOur IAN segment grew 20.5% organically, led by media, data and technology, with solid contributions from global integrated networks.\nMost disciplines showed strength, particularly healthcare.\nOur DXTRA segment had 15.1% organic growth, with strong increases from last year's heavily impacted Q2 across Octagon's sports/entertainment and Jack Morton's experiential offerings.\nLooking at client sectors, we saw comprehensive acceleration.\nAll eight major sectors had double-digit increases year-over-year.\nAuto, retail and other sectors grew over 20%, consumer goods, tech/telecom and healthcare increased mid to high teens, while food/beverage and financial services grew low double-digits.\nRegarding operating expenses and profitability, our teams again showed outstanding discipline.\nWhile maintaining appropriate cost control, we continue investing to support accelerating growth.\nWe're still benefiting from cost improvements from last year's strategic restructuring, especially in payroll and occupancy expenses.\nWe also continue seeing benefits from low variable expenses due to highly restricted global travel and cost efficiencies of a largely remote workforce.\nLooking ahead to post-pandemic work life, we expect expenses for travel, meetings, office utilities etc. will start returning in H2, most notably in Q4 and into next year.\nOur Q2 net income was $263.3 million as reported.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $405.8 million with a 17.9% margin on net revenue.\nOur results show significant operating leverage versus both last year and 2019 on base payroll and office/other expenses.\nWe delevered on performance-based incentive compensation accruals, but operating performance is tracking well ahead of planned targets.\nDiluted EPS was $0.66 as reported and $0.70 adjusted for after-tax amortization of acquired intangibles.\nLooking to the rest of the year, recall that in April we shared a full-year 2021 outlook assuming reasonably steady public health and economic recovery progress.\nWe projected 5-6% full-year organic growth and ~15.5% adjusted EBITDA margin.\nGiven our very strong Q2 and recently refreshed H2 outlook based on client/team conversations, we believe it's appropriate mid-year to upgrade those expectations.\nWe must acknowledge the COVID pandemic and related macro risks aren't fully behind us.\nLooking ahead, we recognize lagging vaccination rates globally and new variants may increase COVID risk.\nWe'll watch this closely entering H2, especially our seasonally important Q4.\nAssuming continued public health progress, we believe we can deliver 9-10% full-year organic growth.\nAt that growth level, we'd expect ~16% 2021 adjusted EBITDA margin.\nWe see this as another year of strong value creation for all stakeholders.\nWe'll keep you updated as the year progresses and look forward to those discussions.\nWith that, I'll hand over to Ellen for a deeper look at our results.\nI hope everyone is safe and healthy.\nAdjusted EBITDA before a small restructuring adjustment was $405.8 million, with a 17.9% margin.\nThese levels compare very favorably to any previous Q2.\nWith accelerated growth, some variable expenses still lag and we're seeing structural benefits from last year's restructuring.\nDiluted EPS was $0.66 as reported and $0.70 adjusted before after-tax amortization of acquired intangibles.\nTurning to slide 3, you'll see our Q2 P&L.\nI'll cover revenue and operating expenses in detail in following slides.\nMoving to Q2 revenue on slide 4.\nQ2 net revenue was $2.27 billion, up $416.2 million year-over-year.\nVersus Q2 2020, exchange rates had a positive 3.1% impact with a weaker USD against most major market currencies.\nNet divestitures were -40 basis points.\nOrganic net revenue growth was 19.8%, bringing us to 10.6% organic growth for H1.\nAt the bottom, we break down segment revenue.\nIAN grew 20.5% organically.\nWe saw notably strong growth in media, data and tech, McCann, FCB (driven by healthcare), MullenLowe, Huge and R/GA.\nIPG DXTRA grew 15.1% organically, reflecting some recovery in events and sports marketing, which were most impacted by the pandemic.\nPR offerings also had solid growth.\nSlide 5 shows organic revenue change by region.\nThe US, 63% of Q2 net revenue, grew 17.4% organically.\nRevenue fell 8% in the same period last year.\nYear-over-year performance was very strong across media, data and tech, FCB (healthcare-driven), IPG DXTRA, McCann, MullenLowe and Huge.\nInternational markets were 37% of Q2 net revenue and increased 24.4% organically.\nYou may remember that the same market experienced a decline of 13.1% in the second quarter of the previous year, with regional variations ranging from -10% to -15%.\nThe growth in Continental Europe was 27.9%, with particularly strong performance in Germany, Spain, and France.\nSeveral operational highlights were observed in the region, primarily in media, data and technology, McCann, R/GA, and DXTRA.\nThe UK saw an organic increase of 18.7%, led by McCann, DXTRA, media, data and technology, and R/GA.\nAsia-Pacific experienced 14% organic growth.\nOur organic growth was driven by Australia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and India, while China and Japan saw declines.\nLatin America showed remarkable organic growth of 49%, with exceptional results across the region, including Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina.\nOur other markets group grew by 29.2%, with notably strong performance in the Middle East and Canada.\nLet's move on to operating expenses for the quarter, as shown on slide six.\nOur operating expenses, excluding billable expenses, amortization of acquired intangibles, and restructuring charges, increased by only 11% compared to last year, while net revenue grew by 22.5%.\nThis resulted in an expansion of the second quarter margin to 17.9% from 9.4% a year ago.\nWe continue to observe efficiencies in various expense categories, as we did in the first quarter of this year, both structural and variable.\nIn the structural category, we are seeing the benefits of the strategic restructuring actions initiated in the second quarter of last year and continued throughout the second half.\nThese actions involved eliminating certain positions and reducing headcount, which will not return with revenue growth.\nWe also reduced our real estate footprint by 15% last year.\nWe are currently experiencing the benefits of most of these actions, and at full implementation, they will generate $160 million in annual cost savings.\nThroughout the pandemic, we have also seen a sharp decrease in certain variable operating expenses.\nSpecifically, I would highlight lower travel and related expenses, which was the case in the second quarter of 2020 and has continued through Q2 2021.\nAs shown on this slide, the ratio of total salaries and related expenses as a percentage of net revenue was 65.4%, a significant improvement from the second quarter of 2020 when revenue had decreased sharply.\nWe achieved very strong leverage on our expense for base payroll, benefits, and tax, which accounted for 53% of net revenue in the quarter.\nThis reflects the benefit of last year's restructuring and the fact that the pace of new hiring lags behind our significant revenue growth, as has been the case in previous business cycles.\nOur severance expense ratio also decreased significantly to only 40 basis points of net revenue, compared to 3% in Q2 2020, which was elevated due to the impact of the recession.\nConversely, our expense for performance-based incentive compensation increased to 6.4%, in line with our very strong operating results.\nExpense for temporary labor also increased as a percentage of net revenue to 4.5%, due to servicing the rapid acceleration of the top line.\nAt the end of the quarter, total worldwide headcount was approximately 53,000, a 1.4% increase from a year ago and up 5.2% from the beginning of this year, with hiring to support our growth.\nAdditionally, our office and other direct expenses decreased as a percentage of net revenue by 380 basis points to 13.3%.\nOur occupancy expense decreased to 5% of net revenue, mainly due to the restructuring of our real estate and leverage on our revenue growth.\nWe achieved leverage across all other office and other direct expenses by 220 basis points, reflecting lower expenses for bad debt and acquisition costs, as well as leverage resulting from our revenue growth.\nOur SG&A expense was 1.3% of net revenue, with the increase from a year ago due to higher unallocated performance-based incentive expenses and increased employee insurance expenses, which were at a very low level a year ago.\nSlide seven presents details on adjustments to our reported second quarter results, providing greater clarity and a picture of comparable performance.\nThis begins on the left-hand side with the reported results and progresses through to adjusted EBITDA and our adjusted diluted EPS.\nOur expense for the amortization of acquired intangibles in the second column was $21.6 million.\nThe restructuring refinement in the quarter is a benefit of $200,000.\nTo be clear, this is a small adjustment to the estimate of the 2020 restructuring program.\nBelow operating expenses in column four, we had a pre-tax loss in the quarter of $1.7 million in other expenses due to the disposition of small non-strategic businesses.\nAt the bottom of the slide, you can see the after-tax impact per diluted share of these adjustments was $0.04 per share, which bridges our diluted earnings per share as reported at $0.66 to adjusted earnings of $0.70 per diluted share.\nOn slide eight, we turn our attention to cash flow in the quarter.\nCash from operations was $468.2 million, compared to a use of $87.1 million a year ago.\nWe generated $101.6 million from working capital compared to a use of $264.9 million last year.\nInvesting activities amounted to $43.3 million in the quarter, mainly for capital expenditures of $34 million.\nFinancing activities used $101.8 million, primarily for our dividend.\nOur net increase in cash for the quarter was $325.6 million.\nSlide nine shows the current portion of our balance sheet.\nWe ended the quarter with $2.34 billion in cash and equivalents.\nUnder current liabilities, the current portion of long-term debt refers to our $500 million, 3.75% senior note maturing in October of this year.\nWe plan to repay these notes from cash on hand.\nSlide 10 depicts the maturities of our outstanding debt.\nWe have a maturity in October of this year, and then only $250 million due in April 2024.\nAfter that, our next maturity is not until 2028.\nIn summary, on slide 11, our teams continue to perform at a high level in an unprecedented environment.\nI want to reiterate our pride in and gratitude for the efforts of our people.\nThe strength of our balance sheet and liquidity means that we remain well-positioned, both financially and commercially.\nWhile we are very pleased with our results, it's worth reiterating, as Ellen just mentioned, that we are operating in an unusual, in fact, unprecedented environment.\nImportantly, it's worth noting that when compared to our non-pandemic results in 2019, Q2 results show our company is performing at a very high level.\nWe believe this is the result of strategic decisions we've made over several years to position our company for the future, investments and actions that have created a sustainable advantage for our organization.\nToday's IPG delivers addressable and accountable digital marketing programs, combined with our world-class creative storytelling capabilities, making us higher value partners to our clients.\nOne of our key priorities over the years has been the creation and implementation of open architecture solutions, where we bring the best of IPG together in collaborative teams customized to client-specific business needs.\nAn increasingly important element of this approach, which we might call Open Architecture 2.0, is Acxiom, whose data management expertise and data assets play a role in an increasingly broad range of our offerings.\nAdditionally, Kinesso powers many of our applications and services that provide clients with a deep understanding of audiences, offering insights that inform creative work, segments for media delivery, and visibility into the effectiveness of our collaborative efforts.\nWe saw this model come to life in the quarter with a Cigna account win, which combined talent from McCann Worldgroup Initiative and R/GA, powered by Kinesso and Acxiom.\nThis continues several years of strong performance in integrated pitches, especially those that include creative and media, as well as media and data.\nAnother key decision contributing to our success has been our continued investment in strong agency brands, which helps us attract and retain top talent and deliver breakthrough creative ideas across a range of marketing disciplines.\nAs a result of this strategy, IPG companies across our portfolio earned several important accolades during the quarter.\nMost notably, we had an impressive showing at the 2021 Cannes International Festival of Creativity.\nIPG agencies won eight Grand Prix, the festival's highest honor.\nWins across the network represented a wide range of clients, categories, agencies, disciplines, and geographies.\nFCB's performance was particularly outstanding, as the agency won four Grand Prix and was named Global Network of the Year.\nThe agency's creative community and leadership deserve credit for this remarkable achievement.\nFCB Health was also named Healthcare Network of the Year, and AREA 23, an FCB Health Agency, was named Healthcare Agency of the Year.\nMcCann client Microsoft was named Marketer of the Year at the festival, another major honor.\nThe agency also won a Grand Prix in brand experience and activation for its remarkable \"True Name\" work for Mastercard, which empowers transgender and non-binary cardholders to use their true name when using their credit card.\nIn PR, McCann Paris earned a Grand Prix, partnering with Weber Shandwick for a campaign that ran across the Middle East, teaching women to perform self-checks for early breast cancer detection in a culturally sensitive way.\nFCB Chicago and Weber Shandwick collaborated to earn a Grand Prix for work with AB InBev.\nR/GA continues to be recognized for humanizing technology, earning a Grand Prix in social and influencer marketing for its innovative work with Reddit during the Super Bowl.\nDeutsch LA and The Martin Agency were included in Ad Age's prestigious A-list in their annual A-List and Creativity Awards.\nInitiative was honored as Media Agency of the Year, while FCB Health's CEO received the title of Executive of the Year in our industry.\nWe made several announcements at the holding company level that set us up for future success.\nThe most significant announcement was the recent launch of IPG Health.\nThis initiative will bring together our top-performing companies, FCB Health and McCann Health, under a new global network called IPG Health, led by a dynamic and experienced CEO along with a skilled executive team.\nIn this new structure, the individual agency brands within FCB Health and McCann Health will maintain their identities and continue to operate independently in the market.\nThese agencies will also gain access to additional specialized services, knowledge exchange, proactive career development, shared investment in new capabilities and skills, complementary geographic coverage, and enhanced collaboration.\nHealthcare and well-being are becoming increasingly important areas for our clients and society as a whole.\nThe healthcare sector is becoming an increasingly vital part of the economy, with innovation playing a more crucial role in driving success.\nConsolidating IPG's dedicated healthcare networks under IPG Health reinforces our leading position in this dynamic sector.\nThe combination of our scale, reach, and most importantly, the quality of our people and work is exciting.\nWe believe this new offering will continue to deliver exceptional results in the coming years.\nThis month, we expanded our portfolio of marketing technology and e-commerce providers by launching Performance Art, a data-driven creative CRM agency with leadership known for developing platform-level creative ideas suitable for both e-retail flows and traditional 30-second commercials.\nRegarding our agencies' performance, IAN's growth in the quarter was once again led by media, data and tech, and FCB, particularly in healthcare.\nUM secured significant new clients this quarter, including Enterprise Holdings, Behr Paint, and most recently, NYC & Company, New York City's official marketing and tourism organization.\nUM also successfully retained the Australian government account.\nAt the Campaign Agency of the Year Awards, UM was named Global Media Agency of the Year, and UM APAC was recognized as the Best Media Network in that region.\nInitiative was named 2020's Most Competitive Network Globally in Media Pitches and won a major account in the UK with banking and insurance company NatWest Group.\nReprise continues to show impressive momentum, especially in its growing e-commerce capabilities.\nAcxiom, Kinesso, and Matterkind are performing well and are crucial in helping clients succeed in the addressable media market, which requires flexibility due to the rapidly changing landscape.\nAcxiom continues to invest in innovative new products and services, such as customer data platforms and identity resolution, which are seeing increased client adoption.\nAcxiom also deployed its latest customer intelligence platform on the cloud for a key financial services client.\nFCB, McCann, and MullenLowe Group were recognized in the ACT Responsible 2020 Good Report, a unique ranking of the world's best creative communications promoting sustainability and social responsibility.\nFCB Global continues to invest in talent and new offerings, hiring a head of data science and connections to expand its expertise in commerce, data, and technology-driven creativity.\nMcCann continues to demonstrate its creative prowess, recently being named Webby Network of the Year, with McCann New York named Webby Agency of the Year.\nMRM is leveraging its Martek expertise and experiencing strong growth with its MRM commerce division, which helps marketers drive engagement, interaction, and conversion on commerce platforms.\nMullenLowe Group's Mediahub continues its strong new business momentum, adding Hallmark's parent company, Crown Media, and Tally Financial during the quarter.\nMullenLowe is also a global leader in purpose-driven work, partnering with governments worldwide to promote the benefits of COVID-19 vaccination.\nR/GA's London office was named the UK's Digital Agency of the Year by Campaign, and added two new clients: financial services company Allianz and Vollebak Clothing.\nWe appointed a new CEO at Huge, who joined the digital agency after a successful tenure at Initiative, where he helped transform the agency into a leader in the media space.\nHuge also saw strong new business activity, adding Sub-Zero Appliances, Wakefern, Tezos Foundation, and Nikko Asset Management.\nThe Martin Agency continues to impact culture and drive strong business results for its clients, notably selling the city's short film for DoorDash at the Tribeca Film Festival, which captured the resilience of New York City's restaurants and their role in the city's life.\nAt IPG DXTRA, several companies were recognized for their ability to deliver creative solutions.\nWeber Shandwick was the most awarded PR agency at Cannes this year.\nCurrent Global demonstrated their commitment to closing the disability and inclusion gap by creating guidelines and toolkits for marketers to make content more accessible for consumers with sight, hearing, or other cognitive impairments.\nJack Morton launched a return-to-live dashboard, a tool for brand marketers to assess where, when, and how businesses in the US can safely resume hosting live experiences.\nGolin continued its strong performance in new business, being selected as LinkedIn's Global Social Media Agency of Record and Agency of Record for Yamaha Music.\nGolin was also named PRWeek's Global Agency of the Year.\nReturning to the holding company, our long-term focus on ESG, including diversity, equity, and inclusion, is a key area worth mentioning.\nWe are working to strengthen this commitment in all our operations and activities, including reassessing how we hire, train, and promote a diverse workforce, incorporating rigorous practices around data ethics and media responsibility, and further reducing our greenhouse gas emissions worldwide.\nIPG was recently named by Forbes to their top ten list of America's Best Employers for Diversity.\nWe created a new position, our industry's first culture officer, to focus on long-term thought leadership relating to social justice issues for underserved and underrepresented communities.\nAs part of our integrated ESG efforts, we announced an action plan consisting of three climate goals: committing to set a science-based target, sourcing 100% renewable electricity by 2030, and joining the Climate Pledge co-founded by Amazon and Global Optimism.\nWe published our first SASB report, becoming the first company in the advertising and marketing sector to align with SASB's industry standards.\nOur agencies also contribute significantly to our ESG profile, with media brands taking a leading role in promoting greater media equity by committing to invest at least 5% of client budgets in black-owned media by 2023.\nOctagon launched an accelerator program with historically black colleges and universities for students interested in sports and entertainment careers.\nR/GA created an innovative program to raise money for environmental organizations through a dedicated YouTube channel playing nature videos, directing all ad revenues to environmental NGOs.\nMany of us look forward to working live with colleagues and clients, given that we're an ideas-driven service business.\nWe expect to have more people returning to our offices in a flexible hybrid model in the US, beginning in mid-September, as is already the case in certain other parts of the world.\nWe will be mindful of the public health situation and the lessons learned during the past 16 months regarding flexible work practices.\nThe costs associated with live collaboration and travel will begin to return as a normal part of our work and be reflected in our operating results.\nWe expect an increase in travel costs in the fourth quarter, potentially returning to levels consistent with the fourth quarter of 2019.\nThese are unprecedented times, and none of us has experience in emerging from a pandemic.\nWe shared our perspective on the balance of the year, assuming a reasonably steady course of macro recovery, continued vaccinations, and adequate mitigation of dangerous new variants.\nWe've delivered a very strong first half of the year on top of the most challenging comparisons in our industry.\nDespite continued macro uncertainty, we have greater clarity for the balance of 2021.\nWe believe that current performance, combined with the continued execution of our long-term strategy, are significant drivers for sustained value enhancement for all our stakeholders.\nWe remain committed to sound financial fundamentals, including debt reduction and continuing to grow our dividend.\nWe also focus on resuming our share repurchase program and will keep you informed of our progress as the year develops.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:We're all eager to move past the difficulties of 2020, and although the pandemic remains widespread, there's hope on the horizon as we cautiously approach 2021 with expectations of improvement.\nIn 2020, we maintained our long-term strategic focus while prioritizing employee wellbeing, adapting work methods, and meeting client expectations.\nOur decade-long investment strategy has positioned us well to capitalize on future industry trends by anticipating shifts in client needs.\nOur investment in capabilities and client-centric approach has generated positive momentum in our business, becoming more evident as the year progressed by better addressing client needs during challenging times.\nWe've experienced six consecutive months of positive net long-term inflows, amounting to nearly $18 billion in the latter half of 2020, with progress across various sectors, regions, and asset types.\nThe retail sector saw significant improvement in flows during the second half.\nOur institutional pipeline, supported by our solutions, remained near peak levels.\nWe observed net inflows of $17 billion in the Asia Pacific region during the second half, with improving flows in EMEA and the Americas, while fixed income continued to show robust net long-term flows.\nThese combined factors create a strong foundation as we enter 2021, with several notable fourth quarter highlights.\nInvestment performance for many of our high-demand capabilities ranked in the top quartile during the quarter.\nWe experienced net long-term inflows of nearly $10 billion in the quarter, with continued inflows in fixed income and increased demand for equities, particularly in ETFs, quantitative, and index strategies.\nThe Asia-Pacific region maintained strong inflows, while flows in the Americas turned positive.\nWe also enhanced our operating leverage, cleared our credit facility, and improved our cash position during this period.\nOur competitive strengths and key capabilities align well with areas of high client demand, positioning us for growth in 2021.\nWe aim to expand our market-leading position in ETFs, particularly in the US and EMEA, and build our passive presence in Asia-Pacific.\nAs the fourth-largest global ETF provider, we offer a range of passive and active strategies, including ESG ETFs, and continue to innovate as demonstrated by our recent product launches.\nWe're focused on growing our private markets business, led by our strong real estate and bank loan sectors, while active fixed income and global equity remain key opportunity areas with strong performance and high demand.\nOur solutions efforts continue to be a priority, as clients value our comprehensive capabilities and services.\nWe're investing in our leadership position in Greater China, leveraging our long-standing experience and early mover advantage in the onshore market.\nGiven our investments and recent organizational alignment, we're confident in our ability to drive future growth and success.\nWe remain committed to helping our clients achieve their goals regardless of market conditions.\nOur actively managed funds show strong performance, with 61% and 70% in the top half of peers over 5-year and 10-year periods, respectively.\nWe ended the quarter with $1.35 trillion in AUM, with $132 billion in growth, of which $95 billion came from increased market values.\nThe fourth quarter saw net long-term inflows of $9.8 billion, representing 3.9% annualized organic growth, with positive inflows in both active and passive AUM.\nOur ETFs experienced $6.1 billion in net inflows, including strong performance in US-listed ETFs and growing interest in ESG-related funds.\nRetail net outflows amounted to $800 million during the quarter, offset by positive flows in ETFs.\nThe institutional side experienced net inflows of $10.6 billion.\nThe growth in our passive and institutional AUM is significant for the company and contributed to the positive operating leverage generated during this period.\nAs mentioned earlier, we are observing a trend where ETF inflows are leaning towards products that generate higher fees.\nExamining flows by region, the Americas saw net inflows of $2.2 billion in the quarter, showing a $6.6 billion improvement from the previous quarter.\nThis enhancement was attributed to net inflows into ETFs, institutional investments, various fixed income strategies, and notably, focused sales efforts and improved redemption rates.\nOur global equity products saw an improvement of over $1 billion or 37% from Q3, driven by our developing market fund, which returned to positive net flows in the fourth quarter after experiencing negative net flows in the first three quarters of the year.\nThe UK experienced net outflows of $100 million during the quarter, as positive flows into our institutional quantitative equity capability were counterbalanced by net outflows in multi-asset and UK equities.\nEMEA experienced net outflows of $1.4 billion due to institutional lumpiness and ETF outflows, primarily in our S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 use ETF.\nI mentioned last quarter that Asia Pacific had one of its strongest quarters ever with net inflows of $8 billion.\nIn the fourth quarter, net inflows were even higher, reaching $9.1 billion.\nNet inflows were spread across various countries in the Asia Pacific region.\nOf the total net flows, $4 billion came from Japan, $3.8 billion from our China JV, and the remaining $1.3 billion was generated from several other countries in the region.\nIt's noteworthy that we continued to see strength in fixed income across all channels and markets in the fourth quarter, with net long-term inflows of $8.2 billion.\nThis follows net long-term inflows of $8.8 billion in the third quarter and $6 billion in the second quarter.\nIt's also important to highlight that of the $26.1 billion in fixed income net inflows in 2020, $25 billion came from active fixed income capabilities.\nActive fixed income has been a growth area for us in 2020 and remains a key investment focus for 2021.\nLet's move on to slide 10.\nOur institutional pipeline remains strong at $30.5 billion, following significant progress in the institutional pipeline during the fourth quarter.\nThis pipeline is diverse across asset classes and regions, and our solutions capability has contributed significantly to growth across our institutional network, justifying our continued investment in this key capability in 2021.\nLooking at slide 11, you'll notice that our revenues increased by $135 million or 12.4% from the third quarter, driven by higher average AUM in Q4 and a substantial increase in performance fees.\nNet revenue yield excluding performance fees was 36 basis points, unchanged from the Q3 yield level.\nThe impact of rising markets on our yield was offset by a slight fee rate decline due to the mix shift we experienced across products in the quarter, as well as the impact of non-management fee earning AUM.\nWe recorded performance fees of $78 million in the fourth quarter, with $48 million coming from our real estate business and $21 million from our institutional business and China JV, two of our key growth areas.\nTypically, we tend to see higher performance fees in the fourth quarter.\nTotal adjusted operating expenses increased by 8.3% in Q4.\nThe $57 million increase in operating expenses was primarily due to higher variable compensation resulting from both market growth and compensation related to the performance fees in the quarter.\nOperating expenses remained lower than historical activity levels due to pandemic-driven impacts on discretionary spending, travel, and other business operations that continued in the quarter.\nHowever, we did observe a seasonal increase in marketing expenses as anticipated.\nMoving to slide 12, we want to update you on the progress we've made with our strategic evaluation.\nAs previously mentioned, we conducted a strategic evaluation across four key areas of our expense base: our organizational model, our real estate footprint, management of third-party spend, and technology and operations efficiency.\nThrough this evaluation, we will invest in key growth areas, including ETF, fixed income, China solutions, alternatives, and global equities, while creating a permanent net improvement of $200 million in our normalized operating expense base.\nAs we noted, a significant portion of the savings will come from compensation, which includes realigning our client-facing workforce to support key growth areas and relocating to lower-cost locations.\nIn the fourth quarter, we realized $7.5 million in cost savings, with $7 million related to compensation expense as shown on slide 12.\nThe remaining $500,000 in savings were related to facilities, which are reflected in the property, office, and technology category.\nThe $7.5 million in savings, which amounts to $30 million annually, represents 15% of our projected $200 million net savings goal.\nWe expect about half of the remaining $170 million in net savings to come from reductions in compensation expenses.\nThe other half will be distributed among occupancy, technology expenditures, and general administrative costs.\nRegarding the timeline, we anticipate achieving approximately $150 million or 75% of the run rate savings by year-end, with the rest realized by the conclusion of 2022.\nWe project that about 75% of the planned compensation cuts, 50% of the expected reduction in occupancy costs, and all of the G&A reductions will be implemented in 2021.\nMost of the efficiencies identified in our technology spending won't be realized until 2022.\nIn Q4, we incurred $104 million out of our estimated total restructuring costs of $250 million to $275 million.\nWe anticipate the remaining transaction costs for implementing this program to range from $150 million to $175 million over the next two years, with roughly two-thirds of this occurring in 2021.\nIt's important to note that the expenses related to the strategic evaluation are not included in our non-GAAP results.\nRegarding Q1, following improved market performance and asset inflows in Q4, we begin the year with over $1.3 trillion in assets under management.\nGiven the market improvement was more concentrated towards the end of the quarter, we expect both operating revenues excluding performance fees and the associated variable expenses to be slightly higher in the first quarter.\nThis reflects the impact of market growth and slow growth that occurred throughout Q4, even if we assume market conditions remain unchanged from year-end.\nOn the expense side, this will include higher associated variable compensation due to the seasonal increase in payroll taxes, partially offset by lower compensation related to the seasonal decline in performance fees and the implementation of our targeted cost savings.\nAdjusted operating income increased by $78 million to $485 million for the quarter, driven by the factors we just discussed.\nAdjusted operating margin rose by 230 basis points compared to Q3, reaching 39.5%, demonstrating the operating leverage in our business model.\nThis contributed to a 19% increase in adjusted earnings per share to $0.72.\nWe also benefited from higher non-operating income and lower non-operating expenses in the quarter.\nNon-operating income included $31.9 million in net gains for the quarter, up from $15.2 million in net gains last quarter.\nThe increase was primarily due to unrealized gains in our seed money holdings.\nInterest expense of $24.4 million was 28% lower than the previous quarter.\nQ3 was the final quarter in which we paid dividends related to our forward purchase agreements, with a portion settled in January and the remainder to be settled in April 2021.\nOur tax rate for Q4 was 21.7%.\nThe lower rate reflects reduced taxes on unrealized gains in our seed portfolio due to the location of our holdings.\nWe estimate our 2021 non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 23% and 24%.\nThe actual effective tax rate may differ from this estimate due to the impact of non-recurring items on pre-tax income and discrete tax items.\nWe reduced our revolver balance by $90 million to zero in the quarter, in line with our commitment to improve our leverage profile.\nIn addition to using excess cash to reduce leverage, we aim to enhance liquidity and financial flexibility.\nOur balance sheet cash position improved to $1.4 billion in Q4 from $1.1 billion at the end of Q3, with $764 million of this cash held for regulatory requirements.\nWe paid $117 million in early January to settle a portion of the forward share repurchase liability, with the remaining $177 million to be settled in April.\nWe believe we're making good progress in our efforts to build financial flexibility.\nWe remain committed to a sustainable dividend and to returning capital to shareholders in the long term through a combination of modest dividend increases and share repurchases.\nIn conclusion, Marty will discuss our key capabilities, the organic growth opportunities each presents, and our focus on executing the strategy aligned with these areas.\nWe're also focused on our strategic evaluation and reallocating resources to position ourselves for growth, while maintaining a prudent and cautious approach to capital management.\nOur efforts to improve efficiency and effectiveness in our platform, combined with our work in building a global business with a comprehensive range of capabilities, puts Invesco in a strong position to meet client needs, operate a disciplined business, and continue investing in and growing our franchise over the long term.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:We have presentation materials for our teleconference available on our website's Investor Relations page.\nThe world has undergone significant transformations in 2020 due to the COVID-19 outbreak.\nOur main focus has been safeguarding the wellbeing of our staff and clients while maintaining operational continuity to meet customer demands.\nAll 34 of our global facilities are functional, and we're meeting all client requirements.\nI'm impressed by our team's efforts in maintaining customer service and progressing with integration plans, which are proceeding smoothly.\nConsidering the weak second quarter, we're satisfied with our third-quarter performance.\nOur sales increased by 28% from the previous quarter but decreased 5% year-over-year on a pro forma basis.\nLet me provide more details about our performance by segment and region.\nThe Americas experienced the largest sequential sales growth, with a 48% increase primarily driven by higher volumes.\nAsia Pacific, EMEA, and Global Specialty Businesses showed similar trends, with volume improvements leading to net sales increases of 24%, 21%, and 16% respectively compared to the second quarter.\nWe observed good sequential improvement across all business segments.\nAnother way to illustrate this quarterly sales trend is by examining our three main customer industry groups globally.\nMetalworking showed the highest growth, increasing 39% sequentially from the second quarter, mainly due to automotive OEMs and related suppliers resuming operations after prolonged shutdowns or significantly reduced production in the second quarter due to COVID.\nOur other industry groups, metals and Global Specialty Businesses, also grew by 21% and 16% respectively.\nThese various perspectives on our significant sequential sales increases should provide insight into the quarter's developments.\nOverall, our sequential volumes rose 27%, but pro forma volumes were still down about 10% year-over-year, excluding the positive impact of Norman Hay, which we acquired last October.\nThis roughly 10% decline was observed across all regions and segments.\nAsia Pacific was less affected since China actually showed modest year-over-year growth.\nDespite weakness in our end markets, we continued to gain market share, with our analysis showing approximately 2% organic sales growth due to net share gains this quarter compared to the third quarter of last year.\nI'm pleased with this strong rebound from last quarter, but we haven't fully recovered yet.\nAs previously stated, we estimate it will take at least two more years for our markets to fully recover, with some markets like aerospace, comprising about 3% of our sales, requiring even more time.\nHowever, we expect our sales to rebound more quickly due to projected continued market share gains and potential future smaller bolt-on acquisitions.\nRegarding third-quarter gross margins, they improved significantly compared to both the second quarter and last year.\nThe sequential increase is mainly attributed to higher volumes and their impact on fixed manufacturing costs.\nThe year-over-year increase was primarily due to realizing our manufacturing and raw material cost synergy savings.\nThe current pandemic and its effects are comparable in many aspects to the situation we experienced in late 2008.\nSimilar to that time, we implemented rapid measures to reduce costs in various areas.\nWe've eliminated virtually all discretionary spending, halted new hiring where feasible, furloughed certain positions, and reduced our planned capital expenditures by more than 30%.\nCrucially, we reassessed our integration and synergy strategies in light of the current circumstances, taking additional steps and expediting other synergies when possible.\nThis has resulted in further cost synergies, leading us to increase our synergy achievement forecast once again this quarter.\nOur revised estimate for cost synergies in 2020 is now $58 million, up from our previous projection of $53 million.\nAdditionally, we've increased our projected total synergies for 2021 from $65 million to $75 million, with 2022 expected to reach $80 million.\nWe achieved $17 million in synergies this quarter and anticipate progressive improvements in the coming quarters.\nConsidering the challenging operating environment, we're satisfied with the quarter's performance, noting significant sequential improvements in sales, gross margins, and adjusted EBITDA.\nOur cash flow remains robust, and we've reduced our net debt by 7% or $58 million.\nThe ability of our business to generate positive cash flow during severe economic downturns, which we've previously discussed with investors, is once again proving beneficial in these difficult times.\nWe expect our markets to show gradual sequential improvement over the next year or two.\nHowever, predicting improvement on a quarterly basis is challenging due to ongoing uncertainty in our operating environment.\nWe anticipate our fourth-quarter adjusted EBITDA to be comparable to the third quarter, and we expect our full-year adjusted EBITDA to surpass $215 million.\nOur increased expected synergies, additional cost-saving measures, improvements in product margins, and cash flow management are expected to continue supporting us during this period of market decline compared to pre-COVID levels.\nLooking ahead to 2021, we project our adjusted EBITDA to increase by over 20% as we continue to realize integration savings, gain market share, and benefit from an anticipated gradual recovery in demand.\nI'm extremely proud of our team's performance in serving our customers, meeting their needs, and successfully continuing our integration efforts, which have been both crucial and challenging for us this year.\nOur employees are our most valuable asset, and ensuring their safety and well-being remains a top priority for us.\nI'm proud and very pleased with our Quaker Houghton team and what we have accomplished and will continue to achieve for our customers and investors, both now and in the future.\nI'll now turn it over to Mary to review some key financial details for the quarter.\nThese are accessible on our website.\nPlease note that we continue to update our risk factors in our Form 10-Q to address evolving COVID-19-related issues, and these risk factors should be reviewed along with those in our 2019 Form 10-K.\nReconciliations are provided in the appendix of this investor presentation.\nIn this review, our comparison periods show actual and non-GAAP results, as well as pro forma sales and pro forma adjusted EBITDA as if we had been combined with Houghton throughout the periods presented.\nKeep in mind that we finalized the Combination on August 1, 2019, so our actual reported and non-GAAP Q3 2019 results only include two months of Houghton.\nPlease refer to slides 6 through 10 as I review some highlights.\nMike reported a sales recovery of $367 million in Q3, a 28% increase from Q2's $286 million, yet still 5% below Q3 2019's pro forma sales of $386 million, primarily due to COVID-19-related volume reductions.\nThe gross margin of 38.2% showed significant improvement from Q2's 34% and last year's Q3 32.3%, which would have been around 35.5% without a purchase accounting adjustment.\nThis quarter's gross margin benefited from an estimated 0.5% increase attributed to a unique price mix.\nAs previously mentioned, the advantages of procurement synergies and manufacturing optimization became more evident with increased volumes, contributing to the sequential improvement.\nFurthermore, cost synergies in these areas continue to grow, as reflected in our updated estimates.\nNon-GAAP operating income bounced back to $43.2 million from Q2's $11.2 million, also surpassing last year's Q3 figure of $34.5 million by 25%, mainly due to the inclusion of Houghton and Norman Hay and realized cost synergies, partially offset by COVID-19's negative impact.\nNon-GAAP earnings per share rose significantly to $1.56 from Q2's $0.21, remaining flat compared to last year due to additional shares issued at the Combination's close.\nThe current quarter's effective tax rate was an 8.1% expense, contrasting with a 27.6% benefit in Q3 of last year.\nQuarterly effective tax rates have been highly volatile due to COVID-19-related profitability changes and ongoing updates to the 2017 tax law.\nExcluding unusual items, we estimate Q3 effective tax rates would have been approximately 24% and 20% for 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nFor the full year, we anticipate an effective tax rate between 23% and 25%, excluding all unusual items.\nAdjusted EBITDA nearly doubled to about $64 million in Q3 from Q2's $32 million and increased by approximately 5% compared to last year's pro forma adjusted EBITDA of $61 million.\nThis improvement is primarily due to realized cost synergies and the inclusion of Norman Hay, which more than offset COVID-19's negative impact.\nCash flow was a notable highlight this quarter.\nAs previously discussed, our asset-light business model, with investments primarily in working capital rather than fixed assets, typically results in significant positive cash flow from working capital releases during major downturns.\nThis was evident in both Q2 and Q3, with year-to-date operating cash flow more than tripling compared to last year, reaching $112 million.\nOur low capital intensity allows flexibility in capital spending, and we're on track to reduce capex by over 30% compared to our original pre-COVID estimate.\nStrong cash flow enabled us to decrease net debt by $58 million, a 7% reduction from Q2.\nThis improved our leverage ratio to 3.4 times from 3.7 times at the end of June, with our bank-calculated leverage at about 2.9 times versus the covenant maximum of 4.25 times.\nOverall, our liquidity and leverage showed significant improvement from already solid levels.\nWe have increased our expected Combination cost synergy estimates to $58 million in 2020, $75 million in 2021, and $80 million in 2022.\nOur history of successfully navigating challenging economic environments through market share gains, disciplined cost management, and strong cash flow generation during major downturns gives us confidence in our ability to overcome current challenges.\nThe strong core operating performance is further enhanced by realized cost synergies from the Combination, which are significantly impacting our financial results.\nWe anticipate a greater than 20% increase in adjusted EBITDA for 2021.\nThe company is well-positioned to capitalize on the expected upturn in business activity.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Presentation materials for our conference call can be accessed in the Investor Relations portion of our website.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has brought about significant changes in the past year.\nOur main focus has been safeguarding the wellbeing of our staff and clients while maintaining business operations to fulfill customer demands.\nAll 31 of our global facilities are functional and we continue to meet our customers' requirements.\nI'm extremely impressed by the Quaker Houghton team's efforts in maintaining customer service and progressing with our integration.\nWe were satisfied with our fourth quarter performance.\nOur overall sales increased by 5% sequentially, with growth observed across all regions and segments, primarily due to higher volumes as our businesses recover from the negative effects of COVID-19 on our end markets.\nThe sequential increase was most pronounced in EMEA, where we witnessed a 13% rise in sales compared to the third quarter.\nIt's noteworthy to compare our revenue changes to the fourth quarter of 2019, which was before the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOur overall sales decreased by only 1% and our volumes remained relatively stable, but there were variations when examined by region or segment.\nAsia Pacific was the sole area showing an increase in volume sold, with an 8% rise compared to the previous year, mainly driven by higher sales in China and India.\nEMEA's volumes were relatively unchanged, largely due to an unusually weak fourth quarter in 2019.\nAmericas experienced a 2% decrease in volumes, primarily due to ongoing COVID-19 impacts on our end markets.\nOur global specialty business volumes dropped by 9%, mainly due to reduced aerospace maskant sales.\nIt's important to highlight that our ability to secure new business and increase market share significantly contributed to our performance, with our analysis showing approximately 4% organic sales growth due to net share gains in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019.\nSo while our overall volumes remained relatively flat, the 4% net share gains made a significant difference, as did our growth in Asia Pacific, helping to offset the negative impact of COVID-19 on our end markets.\nI'm very pleased to see continued improvement from the previous quarter, but we haven't fully recovered yet.\nAs previously stated, we estimate it will take about two more years for our end markets to fully recover, with some markets like aerospace, which accounts for about 3% of our sales, potentially taking longer.\nHowever, we anticipate our sales will rebound more quickly due to projected continued market share gains and acquisitions, which I'll discuss further.\nSince our last conference call, we've completed two small bolt-on acquisitions.\nIn mid-December, we acquired a private US-based company called Coral Chemical for $53 million net of cash acquired.\nCoral provides technical expertise and product solutions for pre-treatment, metalworking, and waste treatment applications in the beverage can and general industrial end markets.\nCoral reported approximately $37 million in net sales and about $5.5 million of adjusted EBITDA in 2020.\nWe expect to achieve annualized synergies of approximately $3 million over the next two years from this acquisition.\nIn February, we purchased assets related to tin-plating solutions, primarily for the steel end markets, for $25 million, which will add full-year net sales of approximately $8 million and about $4 million of full-year adjusted EBITDA going forward.\nWe're pleased with these strategic additions to our product portfolio, which we estimate will contribute about $11 million of EBITDA in 2021, equating to an approximate 7 times EBITDA multiple purchase price for these two acquisitions combined.\nOverall, we were satisfied with the quarter's performance given the current operating environment, and we observed good sequential improvement in our sales and adjusted EBITDA.\nSynergy achievement also impacted our results, as we realized $18 million this quarter compared to $5 million in the fourth quarter of last year.\nAdditionally, our strong operating cash flow of $66 million in the quarter allowed us to further reduce our net debt by $24 million for the full year.\nFor the entire year, we reduced debt by about 12%, in addition to acquiring Coral.\nThe positive cash flow nature of our business during severe downturns is a characteristic we've previously discussed with investors, and we've observed this positive impact again over the past year.\nReflecting on the full year, the past 12 months have been challenging due to COVID-19, but I'm very pleased with our overall performance.\nThroughout the past year, we've continued to service and supply our customers despite difficult economic conditions.\nWe've continued to gain market share and have completed a significant portion of our integration activities.\nWe managed to achieve $58 million in cost savings, surpassing our initial projection of $35 million.\nWe also completed two additional small acquisitions, which are expected to contribute roughly $11 million to our adjusted EBITDA in 2021.\nDespite these acquisitions, we succeeded in lowering our debt by 12%, equivalent to $94 million.\nIn essence, we are realizing the significant advantages we anticipated from our merger with Houghton.\nLooking ahead to 2021, we anticipate some temporary challenges due to increased raw material expenses and reduced automotive market volumes caused by the semiconductor shortage.\nWe hope these are merely timing issues that will primarily affect the first half of the year.\nNotwithstanding these short-term obstacles, we remain optimistic about 2021 and still expect a substantial improvement in our profitability, with our adjusted EBITDA increasing by over 20% from 2020 as we finalize our integration cost savings, continue to gain market share, benefit from an expected gradual recovery in demand within our target markets, and see positive results from our recent acquisitions.\nRegarding the timing and rationale for my decision now, I wanted to ensure Quaker Houghton was in a strong position for this transition, which it is.\nThis year, we will see a significant boost in our profitability.\nWe will largely complete our integration, reduce our debt further, and reach our target leverage ratio.\nWe have implemented the right strategy, assembled a capable management team, have exceptional employees throughout the organization, and see strong potential for above-market growth in our businesses for the foreseeable future.\nFrom my perspective, our future looks very promising.\nThis is the ideal moment to make this transition.\nI am excited to continue my involvement in the company's bright future as Chairman of the Board following my retirement.\nI am incredibly proud of how our team has performed in serving our customers, meeting their needs, and successfully continuing our integration process, which was both crucial and challenging for us this past year.\nOur employees are the cornerstone of our business.\nBy far our most valuable asset, ensuring their safety and well-being is and will remain our top priority.\nI am proud of them and very pleased with our Quaker Houghton team, as well as what we have achieved and will continue to accomplish for our customers and investors, both now and in the future.\nI will now pass the floor to Mary to review some of the key financial details for you.\nThis information can be found on our website.\nPlease note that updated risk factors will be included in our 2020 Form 10-K, which we plan to submit next week.\nWe have used a similar format for this presentation as we did for our Q3 call, where our comparison periods display actual and non-GAAP results, as well as pro forma sales and adjusted EBITDA as if we had been combined with Houghton throughout the periods shown.\nOur Q4 comparisons of 2020 and 2019 in this presentation reflect actual results, not pro forma, as we finalized the merger with Houghton in Q3 of 2019.\nFor the full year comparisons, I will generally compare 2020 to pro forma 2019 results to provide an accurate year-over-year comparison.\nAs Mike mentioned, the gradual recovery in our business that began in Q3 of 2020 continued through Q4.\nQ4 net sales increased 5% sequentially as all segments benefited from a gradual increase in volumes, and net sales were only down 1% compared to Q4 2019.\nHowever, it's worth noting that Q4 2019 was a relatively weak quarter, negatively impacted by a widespread slowdown in industrial production, especially in Europe.\nFor the full year, reported net sales increased 25% in 2020 due to the inclusion of Houghton and Norman Hay.\nHowever, on a pro forma basis, sales were down 9%, primarily due to lower volumes resulting from the global downturn in economic production caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nGross margin of 36.8% in Q4 is up from 34.8% in Q4 of 2019, which was somewhat deflated due to inventory adjustments for purchase accounting for Norman Hay.\nExcluding these adjustments, we estimate Q4 of 2019's gross margin would have been about 35.3%.\nThe increase in gross margin Q4-over-Q4 is primarily a result of our progress in achieving combination-related synergies in logistics, procurement and manufacturing.\nOur sequential gross margin was down slightly from Q3, reflecting a one-time benefit to gross margin in Q3 of approximately 0.5% and current quarter pressure from rising raw material costs and product mix.\nOn a full-year basis, gross margin was 36.2% versus 2019's 34.6%.\nWithout considering comparable expense adjustments from the fourth quarter, we estimate our gross margins for 2020 and 2019 would have been 36.3% and 35.7% respectively.\nWe anticipate achieving additional merger-related cost savings throughout 2021, which should lead to a steady improvement in gross margin.\nWe anticipate approaching a 38% gross margin area by the end of this year as we further realize our merger synergies and adjust prices to counteract increasing raw material costs.\nOur fourth quarter operating income showed significant improvement on both GAAP and non-GAAP bases, with our non-GAAP operating margin of 11.3% being 1.7% higher than the same quarter last year, reflecting a sequential recovery in sales this year, our merger synergies, and the cost-saving measures we implemented to mitigate the impacts of COVID-19.\nAnnual GAAP and non-GAAP operating income also showed significant improvement.\nNevertheless, the annual operating margin decreased due to the COVID-related sharp decline in sales and volumes in the second quarter and the resulting pressure from fixed cost absorption, which we addressed in our second quarter earnings call.\nOur reported effective tax rate was an expense of 4.9% in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to a benefit of 18.2% in the fourth quarter of 2019.\nDisregarding various one-time items, our fourth quarter effective tax rates would have been approximately 30% and 24% respectively.\nFor the full years of 2020 and 2019, we estimate that our effective tax rates, excluding non-core and one-time items, would have been approximately 25% and 22% respectively, aligning with our guidance for this year.\nFor 2021, we anticipate our full-year effective tax rate will fall between 24% and 26%.\nOur non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.63 for the fourth quarter is a 22% increase from $1.34 in the fourth quarter of 2019, primarily due to the improved operating income I mentioned earlier.\nOur full year non-GAAP earnings per share of $4.78 was lower than last year's $5.83 but surpassed the consensus estimate of $4.67.\nSlide 11 displays the trend in our pro forma adjusted EBITDA.\nOur fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA of $65 million is $4 million higher than the same quarter last year and $1 million higher sequentially.\nOur full-year adjusted EBITDA of $222 million exceeds consensus expectations.\nAdditionally, our adjusted EBITDA margins improved for both the quarter and the full year.\nOur fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margin of 17% is 1.5% higher than last year's 15.5%, and on a full year basis, our adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 15.7% from our 2019 pro forma margin of 15%.\nThe improved margins are mainly due to the merger-related synergies we've achieved, partially offset by the impact of lower sales due to COVID-19.\nSlide 12 provides an update on our leverage and liquidity.\nAs Mike pointed out, cash flow was the standout performer in 2020.\nWe've often discussed how the asset-light nature of our business helps us navigate downturns as our main investment is in working capital rather than property, plant and equipment, and we release working capital and generate increased cash flow during economic downturns.\nWe observed this in 2020 during the financial crisis and again this year during the COVID pandemic.\nOperating cash flow for the full year reached a record $178.4 million, enabling us to reduce net debt by 12% to $717.3 million, pay $53 million for the Coral acquisition, net of cash acquired, and distribute approximately $7 million in dividends.\nWe're fulfilling our commitment to prudently allocate capital by prioritizing debt reduction, while maintaining our dividend payments and seizing strategic growth opportunities.\nAs a result of our prudent capital allocation, our primary leverage covenant of net debt to trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA continues to improve and was 3.2 times at the end of 2020 compared to 3.5 times last year.\nWe expect to reach our target level of 2.5 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA by the end of 2021.\nFurthermore, our cost of debt continues to benefit from the current interest rate environment with our borrowing cost under 2%.\nIn conclusion, Quaker Houghton continued to deliver on its commitments in 2020 despite facing very challenging market conditions.\nAt that time, we were in the very early stages of the pandemic with no way of knowing what was to come.\nIt undoubtedly turned out to be a very difficult year, but we concentrated on what we could control.\nWe kept our integration, execution and synergy capture on track and in fact ahead of schedule, we implemented additional cost savings measures to mitigate the decline in sales and we continued to achieve market share gains.\nConsequently, we achieved record cash flow during the year and were able to reduce debt while continuing to execute strategic acquisitions that make financial sense.\nIn 2021, we anticipate seeing a greater than 20% increase in adjusted EBITDA and further expansion of our margins as we realize the full synergy benefits toward the end of the year.\nI'll now hand it back to you, Mike.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Alexandra Deignan serves as the company's Head of Investor Relations.\nOur discussion today includes certain non-GAAP financial measures that we consider important for evaluating the company's performance.\nKenneth Jacobs, Lazard's Chairman and CEO, and Evan Russo, CFO, are leading our call today.\nLazard reported impressive results for Q4 and the full year 2020.\nWe reached a new high in quarterly operating revenue.\nFinancial Advisory experienced its best quarter ever, with strong results across all areas and regions.\nAsset Management's revenue grew by 12% in Q4 and reached a record year-end AUM level.\nWe began 2021 with considerable momentum as we assist clients in preparing for post-pandemic recovery.\nOur M&A activities in Financial Advisory progressed throughout 2020.\nOur global announcement volume grew by 3% despite a 10% decline in market volume.\nThis growth was particularly strong in both the US and Europe.\nNotably, our French and UK announcement volumes increased by 34% and 37% respectively compared to the previous year.\nOur leading global restructuring practice continued to handle a diverse range of complex assignments.\nIn 2020, Lazard topped the league tables for completed restructurings worldwide.\nAs expected, the rate of new restructuring assignments in Europe increased.\nOur sovereign capital and private capital advisory divisions all had successful years advising governments, corporations, and partnerships on financing strategies and fundraising.\nOur private equity secondary business is expanding, and we're advising on numerous growth equity investments globally.\nWe continue to see growth opportunities in Financial Advisory and have accelerated our lateral hiring.\nIn 2020, we recruited 12 new Managing Directors globally, with two more joining in January 2021.\nAdditionally, we're promoting 15 new Managing Directors in Financial Advisory this month.\nTen of these promotions began their careers with us as analysts or associates.\nOur ability to develop talent internally remains a significant competitive advantage.\nOur Asset Management division also had a strong fourth quarter, with increased management and incentive fees reflecting AUM growth and strategy performance.\nOur assets under management grew by $31 billion or 14% during the fourth quarter.\nOur investments in new strategies and product extensions continue to create new growth opportunities.\nOur quantitative business achieved net inflows for both Q4 and the full year, as did our global equities and global and multiregional fixed income platforms.\nWe're also seeing an increase in solution-oriented mandates as we serve more clients with customized strategies.\nWe continue to invest in Asset Management's growth through investments in people, technology, and distribution, as well as developing new funds and expanding existing platforms.\nIn 2020, we introduced eight new strategies for clients across our traditional and alternative platforms.\nThree of these strategies come from independent teams we recently recruited.\nAs the asset management industry undergoes consolidation, we see significant opportunities to accelerate our recruitment of talent and investment teams, adding strategies that complement our existing platforms.\nWe also continue to develop our talent pool internally.\nAsset Management will appoint seven new Managing Directors this year as part of its yearly promotion cycle.\nLazard's record-breaking quarterly results highlight the robustness of our varied business model, worldwide presence, and deeply ingrained culture of customer service.\nWe began 2021 with positive momentum across all our business sectors.\nWe recognize significant growth potential in both Financial Advisory and Asset Management and are making investments to take advantage of these opportunities.\nEvan will now provide additional insights on our performance, after which I will discuss our future outlook.\nLazard's year-end and fourth quarter results demonstrate the resilience and continued excellent performance of our business divisions.\nOur fourth quarter operating revenue reached a record-breaking $849 million for the company, a 20% increase compared to the same period last year.\nThe fourth quarter's adjusted earnings per share rose by 82% to $1.66, showcasing the considerable operating leverage in our business model.\nAnnual revenue of $2.5 billion remained roughly the same as 2019, indicating a robust recovery from the unpredictable market conditions of 2020.\nOur Financial Advisory division achieved an exceptional fourth quarter, with record-breaking quarterly revenue of $509 million, surpassing our previous peak in 2018 by 23%.\nThe impressive performance of Financial Advisory in this record quarter was driven by strong contributions across various advisory practices and geographical regions.\nOur revenue performance showcases the earning potential of the diverse advisory business we have developed.\nIn Asset Management, we saw a similar trend, generating $336 million in revenue for the fourth quarter, a 12% increase from the previous year.\nThis reflected contributions from our global platforms, with accelerating momentum during a year of extreme market volatility.\nManagement and other fees in the fourth quarter increased by 10% compared to the third quarter, reflecting higher average Assets Under Management (AUM).\nFourth quarter incentive fees significantly increased from the previous year, primarily due to strong performance in our alternative investment strategies.\nAverage AUM for the fourth quarter was $246 billion, representing a 3% increase from the same period last year and a 9% increase from the third quarter of 2020.\nThe sequential increase was attributed to market appreciation of $25.4 billion and foreign exchange appreciation of $5.8 billion, partially offset by net outflows of $0.3 billion.\nFor the entire year, we experienced net outflows of $11.4 billion, mainly in our value strategies within emerging markets and local equities.\nPlatforms with net inflows for the year included global and quantitative equities, as well as our global and multiregional fixed income strategies.\nWe concluded 2020 with AUM of $259 billion.\nAs of January 28, AUM stood at approximately $258 billion.\nThe decrease was due to foreign exchange depreciation of $1.3 billion and net outflows of $1 billion, partially offset by market appreciation of $1.3 billion.\nLooking ahead across our organization, client activity in Financial Advisory is robust across our advisory practices globally in an improving economic environment.\nAsset Management has started 2021 well, with AUM significantly higher than its average level for 2020.\nWe have a substantial pipeline of unfunded mandates.\nWe continue to observe demand for both our quantitative and fundamental strategies across our platforms, as well as growing interest in our sustainable and customized solutions.\nRegarding expenses, our compensation ratio for 2020 on an adjusted basis was 59.5%, an increase from 57.5% in 2019.\nOn an awarded basis, our annual compensation ratio was 59.8% compared to 57.7% for 2019.\nThe increase reflected our investments for growth as well as the change in business mix this year.\nWe are maintaining our cost discipline while navigating a volatile market environment.\nNon-compensation expense of $117 million in the fourth quarter was 10% lower than the same period last year, primarily due to continued global travel restrictions and reduced business development costs.\nOur fourth quarter adjusted non-compensation ratio was 13.7%, while the full year ratio stood at 17.1%.\nNon-compensation expenses increased in proportion to the uptick in business activity during the fourth quarter, particularly for variable costs.\nThe effective tax rate for 2020 decreased to 20.2% from 24.1% in the previous year.\nWe anticipate an annual effective tax rate between 20% and 25% for 2021.\nOur company continues to generate substantial free cash flow, supporting our aim to return excess capital to shareholders through our capital allocation strategy.\nWe have maintained a consistent approach to returning capital via our quarterly common dividend throughout the year.\nWe returned $51 million to shareholders in the fourth quarter.\nA quarterly dividend of $0.47 per share on our common stock was declared yesterday.\nWe have restarted our share repurchase program in 2021 to at least counterbalance dilution from year-end equity grants.\nOur remaining repurchase authorization stands at $267 million.\nLazard maintains a robust financial position with sufficient liquidity and balance sheet flexibility.\nOur cash and cash equivalents amounted to approximately $1.4 billion as of December 31.\nKen will now wrap up our remarks.\nLet's discuss our outlook briefly before we take questions.\nThe short-term macroeconomic outlook remains unclear due to the ongoing health crisis.\nNevertheless, fiscal and monetary stimulus in developed nations and global vaccine distribution are fostering expectations of a recovery in the latter half of this year.\nBoth of our business segments are already seeing benefits from growing optimism among boardrooms and investment committees.\nThe factors driving global strategic activity in Financial Advisory have

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Tim Crew, the CEO, John Kozlowski, the CFO, Maureen Cavanaugh, the Chief Commercial Operations Officer, and Steve Lehrer, who oversees insulin biosimilar initiatives, are participating in today's call.\nThe recording will be accessible on Lannett's website for at least three months.\nTim will shortly provide a brief overview of the company's financial performance, recent developments, and ongoing initiatives.\nFollowing that, John will provide a more detailed analysis of the financial results.\nWe wish you continued health and safety as we all navigate the ongoing challenges of the pandemic.\nI'll begin by highlighting some of last year's key achievements that are relevant to our future before discussing the main aspects we anticipate moving forward.\nIn 2021, we continued to introduce new products and expand our future portfolio as our primary focus.\nWe introduced approximately twelve new products, with notable contributions from Levothyroxine tablets, Levothyroxine capsules, and Clarithromycin.\nThe newly launched products from last year created additional revenue streams and further diversified our offerings, reducing our dependence on key products.\nWe also expanded our base product pipeline by maintaining investment in a comprehensive internal product development program.\nFor instance, our recent Mycophenolate approval was obtained in just under 10 months, marking the third product we've developed to achieve first-cycle approval in recent years.\nWe've made significant progress in our internal efforts, including major changes to our portfolio selection process.\nWhile these changes take time to fully reflect in our financial statements, we believe they are creating substantial value.\nAdditionally, we are collaborating with our existing strategic alliance partners to broaden our agreements to include new products.\nFor example, Insulin Aspart was added to our HEC agreement last year, and more recently, generic Spiriva Handihaler was included in our Respirent agreements.\nThese products combined represent multi-billion dollar markets with relatively few anticipated competitors.\nWe also established a new strategic alliance partnership to launch Sevoflurane, a product with limited competition and a market size of approximately $190 million according to IQVIA data.\nWe plan to introduce Sevoflurane in the latter half of the fiscal year.\nThe second major achievement last year was maintaining strict control over expenses and demonstrating operational discipline while launching new products and expanding our pipeline.\nWe implemented and completed a cost reduction plan that involved consolidating our R&D functions to a single location and reduced operating costs by about $15 million annually.\nThe third significant accomplishment was the substantial improvement of our capital structure.\nOver the past year, we paid off our Term A loans using available cash and later successfully refinanced our Term B loans.\nThe refinancing transaction was important for several reasons, as we've often emphasized.\nWe extended our debt maturity to 2026 from 2022, which is now after several of our larger and more significant pipeline assets are expected to launch and contribute to debt reduction.\nWe increased our credit facility and significantly freed up cash flow, primarily by eliminating mandatory principal payments until maturity.\nThe new debt has no leverage covenants.\nAs a result of this refinancing, combined with working capital initiatives, we have improved our cash position.\nConsequently, we now have more readily available resources to invest in growth opportunities.\nAnother noteworthy achievement was that our teams, particularly those in our plants and labs, continued to work daily throughout the pandemic, ensuring a reliable supply of our affordable medicines.\nThis was accomplished despite the additional challenges faced during the past year.\nWe are extremely proud of all these accomplishments.\nHowever, we also faced significant challenges.\nWhile competition is a normal part of the generic industry, the competitive environment we encountered last year was particularly impactful as it involved some of our most profitable products.\nWe offset some of these pressures with the aforementioned new product launches and cost reductions, but the decline significantly exceeded the offsets.\nIn addition to a particularly competitive environment, COVID-19 continued to affect our financial performance with more downstream influences.\nFor instance, as we've mentioned, the pandemic led to fewer elective medical procedures being performed, which reduced sales and use of our cocaine-based product.\nAs a branded product, our Numbrino NDA has a higher than average gross margin for us, so fluctuations in sales have a disproportionate impact on our bottom line.\nFortunately, we believe many of the negative factors from the past year are beginning to diminish, while the positive factors continue to indicate significant opportunities.\nWith that background, and leaving John to discuss the specific financial results, I'll now address our outlook for the upcoming years.\nWe anticipate our overall net sales and gross margin will continue to face pressure due to recent and expected competitive pricing of certain key products, partially offset by the benefits of new product launches.\nWe also expect sales of our Numbrino NDA to be affected by the ongoing reduction in elective surgeries.\nOnce the pandemic subsides, we anticipate an increase in these types of procedures and, consequently, an increase in sales.\nAlthough we anticipate a decline in revenue and earnings this fiscal year, we view it as the lowest point.\nOur primary offerings have already experienced significant competitive price pressure, limiting further downside potential.\nConcurrently, the future prospects of our product pipeline continue to improve.\nIt's worth mentioning that while we believe our generic version of ADVAIR DISKUS could be released in 2022, we haven't included any sales from this product in our fiscal year 2022 projections.\nLikewise, zolmitriptan isn't factored into our fiscal 2022 forecast due to ongoing delays from our active pharmaceutical ingredient supplier.\nHowever, we anticipate both products will significantly contribute to our fiscal 2023 performance.\nLet's now discuss our product pipeline.\nWe continue to introduce products with approximately 13 Abbreviated New Drug Applications awaiting FDA approval, including partner products, plus four additional approved products pending launch.\nWe also have over 20 products in development and plan to add more through both external partnerships and internal efforts.\nOur focus remains on targeting more valuable products compared to our historical average.\nRegarding our portfolio of large, sustainable products, we currently have five disclosed assets.\nIn partnership with HEC, we have two insulin products: Insulin Aspart, a rapid-acting insulin, and Insulin Glargine, a long-acting insulin.\nTogether, these products compete in a U.S. market worth billions of dollars, according to IQVIA data.\nOur respiratory drug-device portfolio, developed with our partner Respirent, now includes three products: generic ADVAIR DISKUS, which has been submitted to the FDA, along with generic Flovent Diskus and generic Spiriva Handihaler.\nThe combined sales of these products also represent a multi-billion dollar U.S. market, as reported by IQVIA.\nAs we've mentioned, all these products differ from traditional generics due to the significant technical expertise required for development and the substantial manufacturing investments made by our partners.\nConsequently, we anticipate only a few competitors for each of these products.\nNext, I'll discuss the significant progress we're making in advancing these large, sustainable product opportunities.\nRegarding generic ADVAIR DISKUS, we've been in regular communication with the FDA about this priority application since its acceptance in May of this year.\nWe're encouraged by their level of engagement.\nWe expect to receive a mid-cycle review update from the FDA in the coming months.\nThus, we anticipate providing a clearer picture of the application's progress during our next investor call in November.\nAt present, we still expect more than one FDA review cycle and believe, as mentioned earlier, that approval and U.S. launch of the product is possible in calendar year 2022.\nFor those unfamiliar with Lannett's story, generic ADVAIR DISKUS is one of the larger assets in our submitted pipeline.\nIt's also currently the closest to expected commercialization in our partnered respiratory portfolio.\nThe second most advanced product in our respiratory portfolio is generic Flovent Diskus.\nThe final patient in the pivotal clinical trial for this product has been dosed, and we expect the trial analysis to be completed within a few months.\nWe're currently planning to submit an ANDA before the end of this fiscal year, with a potential launch in calendar year 2023.\nAs mentioned, we recently expanded our partnership with Respirent to include generic Spiriva Handihaler.\nThe development timeline for this product is expected to be about 12 to 18 months behind the generic Flovent Diskus product.\nHowever, due to various intellectual property considerations, we're not commenting on specific launch timing expectations at this time.\nLastly, as we've previously stated, we're evaluating and negotiating additional product opportunities in the inhalation respiratory space, particularly dry powder inhalers and metered dose inhalers.\nThere continue to be additional multi-billion dollar market opportunities to pursue with both current and future partners.\nNow, let's turn to our two biologic insulin products, starting with biosimilar Insulin Glargine.\nClinical material for the drug product has now been manufactured in the new dedicated manufacturing facility, which is a significant milestone.\nWe still plan to submit an Investigational New Drug application around the end of this calendar year and begin the pivotal clinical trial early next calendar year.\nHowever, we've recently added a few months to the clinical timeline due to current COVID-19 restrictions at the study site in South Africa.\nWe've also added a few more months to our timelines to address interchangeability with the FDA, which I'll discuss shortly.\nAs a result, we currently expect to file the biologics license application in the first half of calendar year 2023 and anticipate launching in the first half of calendar year 2024.\nIt's worth noting that China's equivalent of the FDA, the NMPA, has approved HEC's Insulin Glargine for use in China.\nThat product is manufactured in the same new facility where we've just produced our Insulin Glargine for clinical trials.\nThe additional time we've added to the development plan to address interchangeability with the FDA is related to an important recent FDA approval of the first biosimilar and interchangeable Insulin Glargine.\nWe believe that this interchangeability approval is positive news for Lannett and HEC's insulin products.\nThis demonstrates the FDA's willingness to approve interchangeable insulin products, which should eventually improve affordable access to these crucial medications.\nThe development of biosimilar Insulin Aspart is ongoing, and we presently expect a potential product launch approximately 15 months after Insulin Glargine.\nInsulin Aspart was manufactured in the same facilities, using the same teams and technologies as Insulin Glargine, allowing us to capitalize on earlier Glargine investments in development and production made by both Lannett and HEC.\nSimilar to our respiratory portfolio, we identify multiple opportunities to capitalize on our insulin assets.\nThere are additional dosage forms for both Glargine and Aspart, such as vials and other specific insulin products.\nThese opportunities once again represent multi-billion dollar markets, as reported by IQVIA.\nWe also recognize opportunities to leverage our USA clinical data, development, and related intellectual property, along with HEC's manufacturing capacity, to establish strategic alliances with third parties seeking to expedite their access to insulin products in international markets like Europe.\nWhile discussions about such opportunities are in their early stages, these partnerships could generate significant value for both ourselves and our partners.\nTo conclude, a few brief remarks on Made in America and ESG.\nAlthough we envision a future that includes several high-technology products from overseas sources, we are currently primarily a US-based generic medicines company.\nLannett adheres to stringent US laws and environmental guidelines regarding development and manufacturing compliance for our US-made products.\nMost of our large generic competitors are already based overseas and are not subject to the same regulations, shipping most of their products from across the globe.\nWe take pride in serving the US market from within the US, with an admirable track record and reputation as a high-quality and dependable manufacturer.\nWe highlight these characteristics that make Lannett increasingly unique as a generic supplier so that our investors and customers consider Lannett when thinking about Made in America and various ESG-related initiatives.\nTo summarize today's remarks, our achievements in fiscal 2021 were substantial.\nWe directly confronted a highly competitive market environment.\nWe introduced new products and made significant progress in developing key products in our pipeline.\nWe expanded existing agreements, adding three large, durable assets to our respiratory and insulin franchises.\nWe refinanced our debt, improving free cash flow and extending our maturities beyond the expected launch dates of our major pipeline assets.\nWe maintain our belief that the promising products in our advancing and expanding pipeline have the potential to transform our company into a $1 billion enterprise by 2025.\nI'll start with our financial results on a non-GAAP adjusted basis.\nFor the 2021 fourth quarter, net sales were $106.0 million, compared to $137.9 million for the same quarter last year.\nGross profit was $26.4 million or 25% of net sales, compared to $48.9 million or 35% of net sales for the prior year's fourth quarter.\nR&D expenses decreased to $6.0 million from $6.6 million.\nSG&A expenses decreased slightly to $15.5 million from $15.6 million.\nOperating income was $4.9 million, compared to $26.7 million.\nInterest expense increased to $12.1 million from $11.3 million in last year's fourth quarter.\nNet loss was $7.4 million or $0.19 per share compared to net income of $13.4 million or $0.31 per diluted share.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $12.1 million.\nRegarding our balance sheet, as of June 30, 2021, cash and cash equivalents totaled approximately $93 million, up from $81 million on March 31.\nCash increased during the fourth quarter due to several factors.\nFirstly, as a result of the refinancing, we did not have a principal payment on our debt.\nSecondly, we continued to see working capital improvements from the third quarter.\nThirdly, we received income tax refunds.\nLooking ahead, we anticipate receiving additional income tax refunds, continuing to benefit from initiatives to improve our working capital, and we have no mandatory principal payments on our debt until maturity.\nConsequently, we expect to maintain a healthy cash position throughout the year and end fiscal 2022 with approximately $80 million or more.\nRegarding our liquidity, we also have access to our $45 million credit facility, which we have not yet utilized.\nTurning to our guidance, which as Tim mentioned earlier, does not include sales of generic ADVAIR DISKUS or zolmitriptan.\nFor fiscal 2022, we anticipate net sales in the range of $400 million to $440 million, adjusted gross margin as a percentage of net sales of approximately 23% to 25%, adjusted R&D expense in the range of $26 million to $29 million, adjusted SG&A expense ranging from $58 million to $61 million, adjusted interest expense of approximately $52 million, a full year adjusted effective tax rate in the range of 21% to 22%, adjusted EBITDA in the range of $40 million to $55 million, and lastly, capital expenditures to be approximately $12 million to $18 million.\nRegarding the phasing of the quarters, we expect net sales and adjusted EBITDA in Q1 to be lower than Q4, increasing slightly in Q2 and continuing to rise more in the second half of fiscal 2022.\nThe increase is related to expected new product launches.\nWe anticipate gross margin in the first half of the fiscal year to be in the lower range of our outlook, increasing to the upper end of the range in the second half of fiscal 2022, and operating expenses to remain relatively consistent throughout the year, though we expect Q1 to be slightly higher than the other quarters, as it includes certain compensation-related expenses that are only recorded at the beginning of our fiscal year.\nWith that overview, we are now ready to address any questions you may have.\nSummary: ",

these documents, any mention of adjusted company FFO pertains to the adjusted company funds from operations accessible to all equity holders and unitholders on a fully diluted basis.\nPerformance metrics for individual investments are not meant to be interpreted as a numerical representation of Lexington's past or future financial results, position, or cash flows.\nDuring the question-and-answer segment of our call, Executive Vice Presidents Lara Johnson and James Dudley will be on hand to respond.\nWe experienced an excellent first quarter overall and are continuing to make significant headway in implementing our business strategy.\nThe quarter saw adjusted company FFO of $0.22 per diluted common share, which included $10.9 million in lease termination income, primarily related to a legacy industrial property in Durham, New Hampshire.\nWe acquired three industrial properties for about $51 million and finished a fully leased development project in the Columbus area during the quarter.\nOn average, these investments yielded estimated stabilized GAAP and cash cap rates of 6.1% and 5.9% respectively.\nOur portfolio experienced continued growth in market rents.\nOccupancy remains strong, and our industrial assets accounted for over 91% of gross real estate assets at the end of the quarter, not including assets held for sale.\nWe observed a steady increase in the value of our industrial properties throughout the quarter, and we believe our office portfolio has also appreciated in value as signs of the pandemic easing emerge.\nSeveral factors are contributing to the ongoing increase in the overall value of our assets.\nCapitalization rates are facing downward pressure, replacement costs are rising rapidly, and tenant demand is pushing rents higher.\nOur industrial portfolio is reaping the benefits of all these trends, with the most visible indicator being the first quarter industrial base and cash base rent renewal increases of 14.6% and 5.4% respectively.\nThe factors driving up valuations are also creating a highly competitive investment environment, and we continue to focus our efforts on finding the best risk-adjusted opportunities in our target markets in the Sun Belt and lower Midwest regions.\nThe industrial acquisitions made during the quarter included two facilities in Indianapolis and one in Central Florida.\nFurthermore, we have approximately $206 million worth of assets either under contract or with an accepted offer, which we anticipate closing later this quarter.\nAfter a typical slow start to the first quarter, current deal flow is strong, with over $1 billion of investments under consideration.\nWe are cautious about pricing, as there is still a lot of capital seeking opportunities in a competitive market.\nRegarding development, we are completing the construction of our Atlanta project in Fairburn and have committed to two other projects in our target markets of Indianapolis and Central Florida.\nDevelopment and the acquisition of vacant properties continue to be attractive methods for us to generate stabilized yields exceeding those available in the purchase market for fully leased buildings.\nWe leased 1.5 million square feet during the quarter, and our stabilized portfolio was 97.8% leased at quarter-end.\nOur asset management team has done an excellent job in securing both lease extensions and new leases with increasing rents.\nIn addition to the three lease renewals in our single-tenant industrial portfolio, we increased occupancy at our multi-tenant industrial facility in Antioch, Tennessee to almost 100% while simultaneously raising base rental rates by approximately 16% for the two new tenants within the facility.\nFollowing the end of the quarter, we executed a five-year extension at our 423,000 square foot industrial facility in Lumberton, North Carolina and increased base and cash base rent by 23% and 8.6% respectively.\nOur balance sheet remains in excellent condition, with net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 4.6 times at the end of the quarter.\nAt the end of the quarter, our cash reserves stood at $170 million, including restricted funds, and we had $94.5 million in forward sales through our ATM program.\nOur liquidity position improved during the quarter with $58 million in sales at GAAP and cash cap rates of 6.3% and 6.5% respectively, and will be further strengthened by retained cash flow for the remainder of the year.\nFollowing the quarter's end, we divested our industrial property in Laurens, South Carolina for $40 million.\nWe currently have properties under contract or with accepted offers totaling approximately $135 million in gross price.\nOur remaining portfolio of non-core assets for sale comprises 17 properties, which produced $8.2 million in NOI during the first quarter.\nWe estimate the current value of this portfolio to be around $290 million.\nWe continue to advance our ESG initiatives and have announced long-term environmental objectives.\nWe also distributed a survey to tenants to gather data, receive feedback, and identify partnership opportunities.\nWe became a supporter of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures and joined GRESB as a participant member, with plans to submit our first GRESB real estate assessment report this year.\nThe two properties we acquired in Indianapolis during the quarter are nearly identical, each being approximately 150,000 square-foot Class A facilities constructed in 2019, strategically located in Northwest Indianapolis within a mile of I-65.\nBoth properties are fully leased to two tenants each, with an average lease duration of just under five years and 2.5% rental rate increases.\nIndianapolis' central location, excellent infrastructure, and large, skilled workforce make it highly appealing to various users, especially e-commerce distributors.\nIndianapolis boasts one of the top five cargo airports nationwide, hosting the world's second-largest FedEx hub, and ranks among the top 10 U.S. bulk distribution markets.\nOur acquisition in Lakeland, Central Florida, presents an opportunity to increase value by filling some vacant space in the facility.\nThe property is a newly-built 222,000 square foot Class A warehouse distribution center, primarily leased long-term to Motion Industries, a Genuine Parts Company subsidiary, with 2.5% annual rent increases.\nWe are in discussions with a potential tenant for part of the remaining space and have multiple interested parties viewing the additional area, aiming for a stabilized cash yield of approximately 5.3%.\nLakeland is a key submarket along the I-4 corridor between Tampa and Orlando, two of Florida's largest and fastest-growing metropolitan areas.\nThe property is located near the new Amazon Air Hub facility in Lakeland.\nOur roughly 320,000 square-foot Rickenbacker project in Columbus, leased to a PepsiCo subsidiary, was finished in the first quarter.\nThe projected GAAP and cash stabilized yields are 7.9% and 7.7%, respectively.\nAs mentioned earlier, we continue to have a promising pipeline of ongoing development projects.\nIn Atlanta, our Class A, 910,000 square-foot development project is expected to be largely completed this quarter.\nAtlanta experienced record-breaking positive absorption of over eight million square feet in the first quarter.\nThe airport South Atlanta submarket, where our property is situated, led the Metro area with over five million square feet of positive absorption.\nWe currently estimate our development costs to be around $54 million.\nOur projected stabilized cash yield is estimated at approximately 5.25%, assuming full occupancy and payment of our core Promote by our tenant.\nThe asset is situated in a desirable area along the I-85 in Atlanta's southern submarket, where properties are selling at prices significantly higher than construction costs.\nI will discuss the two development projects we have started funding in Central Florida and Indianapolis.\nThe Central Florida project is a high-quality, 1.1 million square-foot distribution center on a 90-acre plot with I-75 frontage, close to our recently acquired Amazon facility. The projected cost is about $81 million.\nOcala is ideally positioned for statewide distribution in Florida, located just above the I-75 and Florida Turnpike intersection, providing access to major cities and coastal areas, as well as routes to Jacksonville and Georgia.\nOur Indianapolis project in Mount Comfort, which we began financing after the quarter ended, is located 14 miles east of downtown Indianapolis with convenient access to I-70.\nMount Comfort is one of Indianapolis' rapidly growing modern logistics submarkets, offering a favorable workforce compared to other competing areas.\nThe 1.1 million square-foot facility is estimated to cost around $60 million.\nSimilar to our Atlanta development, both projects feature state-of-the-art specifications, including 40-foot clear heights, efficient layouts, ample space for trucks and cars, meeting the needs of e-commerce and other large-scale distributors.\nConstruction is expected to be completed in late Q1 and Q2 of 2022 for the Ocala and Mount Comfort projects respectively, both with projected stabilized cash yields in the mid-5% range.\nWe will provide regular updates on the progress of these developments.\nWe produced adjusted company FFO of about $64 million or $0.22 per diluted common share in the quarter, which would have been approximately $0.19 per diluted common share without the $10.9 million lease termination income.\nQuarterly revenues were $93 million, showing an increase compared to the same period in 2020, primarily due to new acquisitions and the aforementioned termination income.\nProperty operating expenses were around $11 million, with about 88% covered by tenant reimbursements.\nFirst quarter G&A expenses were $8.4 million, and we anticipate our 2021 G&A range to be between $31 million and $33 million.\nOverall, same-store NOI grew by 0.6% and would have been about 1.7% excluding single-tenant vacancy, with our same-store lease portfolio at 97.5% occupancy.\nSpecifically, industrial same-store NOI increased by 1.5% and would have been 2.8% without single-tenant vacancy.\nAt the end of the quarter, roughly 88% of our industrial portfolio leases had escalations with an average rate of 2.3%.\nRegarding capital markets, we increased our ATM program availability to $350 million in the first quarter.\nWe also entered into forward sales contracts for 3.6 million common shares, which have not yet been settled.\nAs of March 31, we had 8.6 million unsettled common shares under forward sales contracts with a total settlement value of $94.5 million.\nAs Will mentioned, our financial position is strong with low debt and ample available cash.\nAt quarter-end, we had no outstanding balance on our unsecured revolving credit facility, and our unencumbered NOI remained high at 91%.\nFurthermore, our consolidated debt was approximately $1.4 billion with an average interest rate of about 3.3% and an average term of 6.7 years.\nSummary: ",

in their reasonableness\nThe most crucial risk factors that could impact our future results are outlined in our yearly report on Form 10-K\nWe suggest you examine those risk factors and other essential information provided in our SEC filings\nI would now like to hand the call over to Melinda Whittington, who serves as La-Z-Boy's President and Chief Executive Officer\nWe are executing our plans and managing the aspects within our control, even during these times of extensive global supply chain disruptions\nThe La-Z-Boy enterprise achieved record-breaking sales of $576 million, surpassing the pre-pandemic fiscal '20 second quarter by 29%\nOur company has grown significantly since before the pandemic, and we believe our current momentum can be maintained\nWe are prepared to expand upon our foundation of nearly $2.1 billion in trailing 12-month sales\nAs anticipated, operating margins improved sequentially, as our delivered sales for the quarter reflected pricing and surcharge measures implemented to counter unprecedented increases in raw material costs\nOverall, we are satisfied with the growth and momentum we are experiencing during these challenging times\nLooking ahead, demand remains strong across the company, and our backlog continues to be at record levels, even as we increase capacity to serve our customers and consumers\nDuring the second quarter of last year, businesses were just reopening, and consumers were resuming furniture purchases\nAt that time, written same-store sales for the La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries network were exceptionally strong, showing a 34% increase\nCompared to that base, written same-store sales for the La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries network decreased by 6% in the fiscal '22 second quarter\nHowever, when comparing this quarter to the pre-pandemic fiscal '20 second quarter, written same-store sales for the La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries network grew by an impressive 26%, resulting in a compound annual growth rate of 12% over the two-year period\nSimilarly, while written same-store sales for our company-owned retail segment decreased by 7% compared to the unusual prior-year period, written sales increased at a compound annual growth rate of 12% over the past two years\nJoybird, primarily an e-commerce business, continued its strong growth trajectory, achieving 56% more business this Q2 than in last year's second quarter and delivering an impressive compound annual growth rate of 40% over the past two years\nAs we focus on addressing this strong ongoing demand and accumulated backlog, we continue to make strategic investments to increase capacity and improve capabilities, producing more units than ever to serve customers\nWe are continuing to add manufacturing cells and now employ almost 40% more manufacturing personnel than before the pandemic\nIn Mexico, additional cells are coming online at our SLR facility, and the first cells at our new [Indecipherable] plants are expected to begin operations in January, with that location fully operational by fiscal year-end\nWe continue to work on minimizing supply chain disruptions, from those associated with a lack of component parts such as electronic chips to those inherent in hiring and training new workers until they reach normal productivity levels\nAs mentioned last quarter, where possible, our procurement team is significantly increasing inventory for key components to minimize disruption while also working to diversify our supply chain with multiple sources in various geographies to protect against continued supply chain volatility\nEarly in Q3, we acquired the Furnico upholstery manufacturing business in the UK\nFurnico has been manufacturing La-Z-Boy products for sale in the UK and Ireland since 2008\nThis expansion of in-house manufacturing capability will provide greater certainty of supply to our customers in the UK and is a key step in building an integrated supply chain network for La-Z-Boy International\nDuring the quarter, we continued to return value to shareholders with a dividend payment and $15 million in share repurchases, bringing our total cash returned to shareholders in the first half of the year to $64 million across dividends and share repurchases\nLast month, we were pleased to announce the expansion of our Board of Directors to 12 members with the addition of Erika Alexander, who serves as the Chief Global Officer, Global Operations for Marriott International\nErika has held various leadership roles for several of Marriott's largest brands and will bring a wealth of operational experience, perspective, and expertise to La-Z-Boy\nWhile managing current operational challenges across the business, we're also addressing the long term with our work on Century Vision, our winning strategy for growth through our Centennial anniversary in 2027 and beyond\nAs noted last quarter, Century Vision includes three key pillars\nThe first is to leverage and reinvigorate the La-Z-Boy brand\nThis includes leveraging the La-Z-Boy comfort message, a renewed focus on attracting younger core consumers, and accelerating our omnichannel offering\nTo date, our marketing platform featuring Kristen Bell has been successful in driving brand recognition, including among younger consumers who say the La-Z-Boy brand is relevant to them\nOur objective is to build on this sentiment, and last month we produced a new series of commercials that showcase how La-Z-Boy's range of products meet our consumers' needs\nThroughout the course of Century Vision, we will expand the vibrant La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries store base to approximately 400 locations across North America and will strengthen the entire network through remodels and relocations, with some 30 projects planned for this fiscal year\nWhile the purchase journey may start digitally, our consumers like to visit our stores to shop, providing us with a great opportunity to deliver the flagship La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries store experience\nOur primary objective is to engage with customers throughout their buying process via various channels, both digital and physical.\nWe've achieved great success in managing our Company-owned stores, benefiting from the combined wholesale-retail margin.\nWe're actively acquiring independent La-Z-Boy Furniture Gallery stores to enhance our portfolio where it's mutually beneficial.\nWe've recently agreed to purchase five stores in Alabama and Tennessee from a retiring dealer, which will be profitable once we smoothly incorporate them into our portfolio in the third quarter.\nThe second component of Century Vision focuses on Joybird, where we have a profitable direct-to-consumer model and a dynamic brand with significant growth potential.\nWe're investing in Joybird to drive substantial profitable growth by increasing digital marketing expenditure, enhancing technology, expanding product range, and opening small urban stores in high-traffic areas.\nWe're thrilled to launch a new store in LA this month, with more planned to open by the end of this fiscal year.\nIn areas with Joybird small format stores, we consistently observe an increase in online sales, showcasing the appeal of an omnichannel approach across all brands and retail formats.\nWe recently introduced a virtual store at Joybird's LA headquarters, allowing online shoppers to interact with a dedicated retail environment via chat, call, or video conference, which has proven highly successful in terms of customer satisfaction and sales conversion.\nThe third aspect of Century Vision involves leveraging and improving our enterprise capabilities to support our consumer brands' growth and enable potential acquisitions that can benefit from our supply chain expertise and accelerate La-Z-Boy Incorporated's growth.\nEnhancing digital capabilities across the entire La-Z-Boy enterprise and improving our supply chain's agility to better support all customer brands will be key priorities moving forward.\nOverall, as we implement Century Vision, we anticipate growing our topline faster than industry averages and achieving double-digit operating margins.\nWe're pleased with our recent performance and optimistic about our future prospects.\nOn a consolidated basis, our second quarter sales for fiscal '22 increased by 25% to a record $576 million compared to the same quarter last year, showing sequential growth from the first quarter of fiscal '22, reflecting strong demand, increased production capacity, and the effects of pricing and surcharges.\nCompared to the pre-pandemic second quarter of fiscal '20, sales were 29% higher, representing a compound annual growth rate of about 14% over the past two years.\nConsolidated GAAP operating income rose by $54 million compared to the same period last year, while non-GAAP operating income increased to $52 million.\nThe consolidated GAAP operating margin was 9.4%, and the non-GAAP operating margin was 9%, showing sequential improvement from the first quarter.\nGAAP diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of fiscal '22 was $0.89, compared to $0.75 in the same quarter last year.\nNon-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.85 in the current quarter, versus $0.82 in the same quarter last year.\nFrom this point forward, my comments will focus on our non-GAAP reporting unless explicitly stated otherwise.\nI will now review our results by segment.\nProduct demand remains strong across all businesses.\nIn our wholesale segment, delivered sales for the quarter grew by 28% to $439 million compared to the same period last year, and increased by 12% sequentially from Q1.\nCompared to the pre-pandemic second quarter of fiscal '20, sales were 25% higher, representing a compound annual growth rate of 12%.\nThe non-GAAP operating margin for the wholesale segment was 9.1%, compared to 12.2% in the second quarter of last year, primarily due to higher raw material and freight costs, start-up costs for new facilities, and labor challenges, partially offset by pricing and surcharges, fixed cost leverage on higher volume, and lower marketing spend as a percentage of sales.\nOverall, we were satisfied with the results and the sequential improvement from the first quarter operating margin of 4.7%.\nIn the retail segment, delivered sales for the quarter increased by 19% to $192 million.\nDelivered same-store sales rose by 17% compared to the same quarter last year.\nCompared to the pre-pandemic second quarter of fiscal '20, delivered sales increased by 30%, representing a compound annual growth rate of 14%, demonstrating the strength of the La-Z-Boy brand and our furniture gallery store system in this environment, as well as strong execution at the store level with positive sales metrics across the board.\nThe non-GAAP operating margin improved to a second quarter record of 12.5%, compared to 9.4% in the same quarter last year, primarily driven by fixed cost leverage on higher delivered sales volume and expense management.\nSales for Joybird, reported in corporate and other, increased by 37% to $40 million compared to the same quarter last year.\nOn a two-year basis, compared to the pre-pandemic second quarter of fiscal '20, delivered sales increased by an impressive 93%, representing a compound annual growth rate of 39%, reflecting Joybird's growing momentum in the direct-to-consumer marketplace as we continue to acquire customers and strengthen brand awareness through new digital marketing channels.\nFor the quarter, Joybird increased both its web and in-store traffic, conversion rates, and average ticket size.\nJoybird is maintaining profitability, and with a focus on accelerating disproportionate growth, we will continue to invest in Joybird marketing to drive broader brand awareness and customer acquisition.\nTo summarize, the consolidated non-GAAP gross margin for the entire company for the second quarter of fiscal '22 decreased by 500 basis points compared to the same quarter last year, primarily due to significant increases in raw material and freight costs, start-up costs associated with expanding our manufacturing capacity, and labor challenges in our wholesale businesses.\nThese factors were partially offset by pricing and surcharges in our wholesale business.\nConsolidated non-GAAP SG&A as a percentage of sales for the quarter decreased by 280 basis points, primarily reflecting fixed cost leverage on higher sales volume, mainly in our retail segment, as well as lower marketing spend as a percentage of sales.\nOur GAAP-based effective tax rate in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 was 26.6%, compared to 26% in the same period of fiscal 2021\nOur effective tax rate differs from the 21% federal statutory rate mainly because of state taxes\nWe anticipate our effective tax rate for the entire fiscal 2022 to range between 25.5% and 26.5%\nWe generated $15 million in cash from operations so far this year\nWe concluded the period with $297 million in cash, no debt, and $31 million in investments to boost cash returns\nYear-to-date, we invested $59 million in higher inventory levels to safeguard against supply chain issues and support increased production and sales\nWe also invested $33 million in capital year-to-date, mainly for retail store improvements, manufacturing and distribution facility upgrades, new upholstery production capacity in Mexico, and technology enhancements\nLast month, we secured a new five-year $200 million unsecured revolving credit facility, replacing our previous $150 million ABL facility\nThe new facility includes a $100 million accordion feature, allowing us to increase our borrowing capacity for future growth\nIt also offers the option to request two additional one-year extensions beyond the initial five-year term\nThe facility's borrowings can be used for general corporate purposes and working capital\nAs of now, we have not borrowed against this facility\nDuring the quarter, we continued our share buyback program, spending $15 million to repurchase over 400,000 shares in the open market, leaving 8.6 million shares in our authorized repurchase program\nWe have returned $51 million to shareholders through share repurchases so far this year\nWe paid $6.6 million in dividends to shareholders in the second quarter\nAfter the quarter ended, the Board of Directors increased the regular quarterly dividend by 10% to $0.165 per share, showing confidence in the company's long-term growth prospects\nLooking ahead, our long-term capital allocation strategy aims to invest about half of operating cash flow back into the business through capital expenditures and M&A, while returning the rest to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases\nDemand trends remain strong across the business, significantly higher than pre-pandemic levels, with a high backlog and plans for increased capacity as new assembly cells come online, we expect a strong year of shipments\nWe anticipate a continued increase in production capacity, especially in Q4\nRaw material and freight costs remain high, and global supply chain disruptions persist\nIndustry experts predict it will take several quarters to resolve West Coast shipping backlogs\nElectronic chip shortages continue to affect our power furniture\nWe expect ongoing supply chain disruptions in multiple areas, particularly for our Company-owned retail segment, which tends to sell higher-end products\nDue to the COVID-related shutdown in Vietnam, we anticipate a significant temporary decline in sales and margin for our case goods business in the third quarter\nWe will continue to monitor the escalating freight environment to determine if further pricing actions are necessary\nWe recognize that uncertainty and disruption are likely to continue for the foreseeable future, particularly in the third quarter\nQuarterly trends will be affected by our third and fourth quarters containing 12 and 14 production weeks respectively, compared to 13 production weeks in our second quarter\nFiscal 2022 will include 53 weeks of results\nConsidering these factors, we expect Q3 sales and margin to be similar to Q2, with sales and margin accelerating in Q4, allowing consolidated La-Z-Boy results to finish the fiscal year with a full-year non-GAAP operating margin at or near double digits\nWe expect capital expenditures to range from $75 million to $85 million for fiscal 2022, supporting various business improvements and investments\nWe are proud of our organization and business partners for delivering strong results in challenging times\nThe team is effectively navigating the uncertain environment and positioning us for strong business growth in both the near term and as we execute our Century Vision\nWe believe the best is yet to come for La-Z-Boy Incorporated as we deliver profitable growth and long-term value for all stakeholders\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:This meeting is being recorded and will be available for playback later.\nYou can find instructions for accessing the replay on our website at mdcholdings.com.\nVarious elements that may influence the Company's actual performance are outlined in the Company's Q3 2020 Form 10-Q, which is anticipated to be submitted to the SEC today.\nIt's important to mention that SEC Regulation G mandates specific information to accompany the use of non-GAAP financial metrics.\nM.D.C. Holdings reported another strong quarter, with home sales revenue increasing by 33%, homebuilding operating margin improving by 370 basis points, and net income growing by 96% compared to the previous year.\nNew orders for the quarter grew by 73% compared to last year, with a sales rate of 6.1 homes per community per month.\nThese outcomes highlight the excellent housing market conditions we're currently experiencing across our regions and show our capacity to expand our operations while enhancing our profit margins.\nHomes are increasingly functioning as offices, schools, and entertainment centers for families, leading people to seek living spaces that can accommodate these new needs.\nWhile this shift has positively impacted the overall housing market, it has been particularly advantageous for the new home sector for several reasons.\nThere is a limited supply of existing homes for buyers to choose from.\nThe National Association of Realtors reports that total housing inventory at September's end was 1.4 million units, down 19% from the previous year and representing less than a three-month supply of homes.\nA newly built home provides buyers with the assurance that they're the first occupants, which is a significant selling point for many families during these uncertain times.\nIn addition to the pandemic-driven demand, a demographic shift towards home buying is expected to provide ongoing support for the industry.\nMore millennials are reaching the age where they typically buy homes, while baby boomers and empty nesters are looking to downsize into homes that suit their changing lifestyles.\nMDC is strategically positioned to benefit from these demographic changes due to our focus on developing communities with affordable housing options.\nHome buyers of all ages are seeking value in their home purchases, and we've found ways to meet their needs through more efficient floor plans.\nWhile lower interest rates and pandemic-related factors have boosted demand across all product types, we believe the more affordable segments of the market will be the most resilient in the long term.\nWe are fortunate to have a strong team at MDC.\nI'm pleased to announce that Rebecca Givens has agreed to take on Michael's role as Senior Vice President and General Counsel.\nIn our operations department, David Viger has been promoted to Chief Operating Officer of our homebuilding operations.\nAnthony Berris has been promoted to President of our Financial Service operations.\nDawn Huth has taken on additional responsibilities as Senior Vice President of National Finance.\nThese individuals have all proven themselves to be highly capable leaders during their time at MDC, and I'm confident they will contribute to our continued success in the future.\nLastly, I'd like to congratulate David Mandarich on his election as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company.\nDavid has been with the Company since 1977, most recently serving as our President and Chief Operating Officer, and is widely recognized as one of the most skilled leaders in the homebuilding industry.\nHis appointment as CEO is a crucial step in our Company's evolution, and I look forward to continuing to work with him on the Company's strategic direction.\nDavid will join me in our future earnings calls.\nOur company experienced robust revenue growth in the quarter, with home sale earnings rising 33% compared to the previous year, reaching $1 billion\nThe homebuilding operating margin saw an improvement of 370 basis points from the same quarter last year, leading to a 109% increase in pre-tax income from our homebuilding operations, totaling $101.7 million\nMoreover, our financial services pre-tax income grew by $10.3 million, representing a 73% increase\nThis growth was attributed to our mortgage division, which benefited from higher interest rate lock volume, increased capture rate, and improved net interest income on loans originated during the period\nConsequently, net income grew by 96% to $98.9 million, or $1.49 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2020\nOur tax rate increased from 19.5% to 21.5% in the 2020 third quarter\nThis rate increase was mainly due to changes in the estimated amount of energy tax credits expected to be received during the respective quarters\nWe currently project a 25% tax rate for the fourth quarter, excluding any discrete items\nThe number of homes delivered increased by 25% year-over-year to 2,147, driven by a larger backlog at the start of the quarter and a slight increase in our backlog conversion rate\nThe average price of homes sold during the quarter rose by 6% to approximately $466,000\nThis price increase resulted from implemented price hikes across most of our communities over the past year, as well as a shift in the mix of homes closed from Nevada to Southern California\nWe anticipate home deliveries for the fourth quarter of 2020 to range between 2,400 and 2,600 units\nThe backlog conversion rate for the fourth quarter will be considerably lower than the same period in 2019 due to the significant year-over-year increase in orders during the 2020 third quarter, many of which are unlikely to be completed this year\nWe expect the average selling price for 2020 fourth quarter unit deliveries to once again exceed $460,000\nThe gross margin from home sales improved by 170 basis points year-over-year to 20.5%\nAlthough we have experienced increases in certain construction costs, particularly lumber, due to the pandemic and other factors, we have successfully offset these increased expenses through home price increases\nThis has resulted in improved gross margins on both custom and speculative home deliveries across all our homebuilding segments\nWe expect the gross margin from home sales for the 2020 fourth quarter to approach 21%, excluding impairments and warranty adjustments\nWe continued to show strong operating leverage during the third quarter, with our SG&A expense as a percentage of home sale revenues decreasing by 200 basis points year-over-year to 10.4%\nOur total SG&A expense for the 2020 third quarter increased by $10.9 million year-over-year, primarily due to variable commissions and marketing expenses that grew in line with our 33% increase in home sale revenues during the period\nOur general and administrative expense slightly decreased compared to the previous year, mainly due to a reduction in stock-based compensation that was largely offset by an increase in salaries and other compensation-related expenses\nOur overall workforce has grown by 5% year-over-year as we strive to support the company's strong growth trajectory\nFor the fourth quarter of 2020, we may see our general and administrative expense rise to between $50 million and $55 million due to the 5% year-over-year increase in headcount, additional bonus accruals in line with strong operating results, and a potential charitable contribution to our Foundation\nAs previously mentioned, due to the continued expansion of our gross margin and improved operating leverage, our homebuilding operating margin, defined as gross margin from home sales minus our SG&A rate, increased by 370 basis points year-over-year to 10.1%\nDriven by this improvement, our last 12 months pre-tax return on equity rose by 560 basis points year-over-year to 21.8%, which is our highest level in 15 years\nLet's examine our net new home order information for the quarter on Slide 9\nThe dollar value of our net orders increased by 89% year-over-year to $1.65 billion, and unit net orders grew by 73%, driven by a 70% increase in our monthly absorption rate to 6.1\nThe average selling price of our net orders rose by 10% year-over-year, driven by price increases implemented over the past 12 months, as well as a shift in mix to California, which has our highest average price\nIn the third quarter, our California markets nearly matched our Colorado markets in terms of net new orders.\nIt's worth mentioning that we concluded the quarter with 194 active subdivisions, slightly more than a year earlier.\nDue to the robust sales activity during the third quarter, several of our subdivisions are nearing completion sooner than anticipated.\nConsequently, we expect to have approximately 185 active subdivisions by the end of the year.\nWhile this would be a decrease from the third quarter's end, it would remain unchanged from the beginning of the year.\nAdditional net new order information by month since April is provided on Slide 10.\nIt's evident that sales activity increased significantly following the initial slowdown related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOrder activity reached its peak in August, but September remained strong and significantly above the previous year, even after we raised prices in most of our subdivisions.\nWe also observed a continued decrease in the cancellation rate as the months progressed.\nWe anticipate some seasonal effects during the fourth quarter.\nNevertheless, October has remained very strong compared to the previous year.\nBased on current activity, we expect our October 2020 net orders to surpass our October 2019 orders by at least 50%.\nAs a result of our strong sales, we ended the quarter with an estimated sales value of $3.1 billion for our homes in backlog, a 47% increase year-over-year.\nThe average selling price of homes in backlog rose 4% due to price increases over the past 12 months, reduced incentives, and a shift towards California properties.\nThese factors were slightly counterbalanced by a shift towards lower-priced communities, in line with our ongoing strategy of offering more affordable home options.\nI will now discuss land activity as shown on Slide 12.\nThe number of lots we acquired this quarter grew by 63% year-over-year, reflecting our confidence in market conditions and our focus on expanding our business.\nAlthough the number of lots we approved earlier this year decreased due to COVID-19 uncertainty, we approved over 3,800 lots for purchase during the third quarter of 2020.\nUltimately, despite significant volatility, the number of lots approved over the last 12 months has increased by 34% compared to the previous year.\nAs a result, our total lot supply at the end of the quarter was 8% higher than at the same time in 2019, supporting our future growth potential.\nWe anticipate continued strong lot approval and acquisition activity in the fourth quarter, given the robust demand we've seen recently and our confidence in future housing growth prospects.\nTo summarize, we are encouraged by the housing market's resilience in the third quarter, considering the immense challenges our country has faced in 2020, and we believe we have executed our operating strategy effectively in this volatile environment.\nMore importantly, we see an opportunity for sustained growth well into the future, supported by solid demographics and changing customer preferences.\nOur current backlog not only positions us for a strong end to 2020 but also provides an opportunity for significant year-over-year increases in home sale revenues and pre-tax income at the start of 2021.\nWith our strong balance sheet and current land pipeline, we are well-positioned to significantly grow our community count in 2021 and have a preliminary target of at least 10,000 home deliveries for the upcoming fiscal year.\nWe are aware of the many risks to achieving this target, especially with COVID-19 still impacting our daily lives.\nThese risks will be closely monitored as we work to grow our Company, and the safety of our employees, subcontractors, and customers will remain our top priority.\nFollowing our strong third quarter, our Board of Directors has declared a 21% increase in the quarterly cash dividend from $0.33 to $0.40 per share.\nThis represents a 33% increase from the previous year and demonstrates our commitment to rewarding our shareholders for their continued support.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:We will refer to this information during our call today.\nThe earnings call will commence with Ward Nye discussing our business status considering the Coronavirus pandemic, our current and planned actions, and our strong position to handle the present situation.\nJim Nickolas will then present our Q1 2020 financial results and liquidity status, followed by Ward's concluding remarks.\nA Q&A session will follow Ward's closing statement.\nWe sincerely hope you and your loved ones are and continue to be safe and well as we face the challenges and uncertainties of COVID-19.\nI want to express my heartfelt appreciation to our Martin Marietta team.\nI'm extremely proud of everyone's collaborative efforts in managing this unprecedented situation and how our employees' character has shone through.\nMartin Marietta employees are consistently meeting our customers' crucial needs safely and resolutely.\nThey're also assisting their local communities in various ways, from donating essential supplies to healthcare workers and first responders, to helping neighbors with grocery shopping and ensuring our colleagues' well-being and safety.\nOur team has demonstrated great bravery, determination, and resilience in meeting our stakeholders' needs while maintaining our core values of safety, integrity, excellence, community, and stewardship.\nThese values are the essence of our character.\nWe rely on these fundamental principles to guide our daily and long-term actions and decisions, especially during challenging times.\nMartin Marietta continues to operate as an essential business.\nThis designation allows us to continue providing heavy building materials and services to our customers, even in areas with stay-at-home orders.\nCommunities nationwide must maintain their critical infrastructure, and we're working diligently to support this goal in a safe, efficient, and responsible manner.\nUntil the end of April, our workforce, operations, and supply chains have experienced minimal disruption.\nWe believe this is primarily due to our company's prompt and decisive response to the pandemic, our domestic-focused approach to sourcing supplies and materials, and our enhanced safety procedures, all aimed at protecting Martin Marietta employees and the company's organizational health.\nDuring this crucial time, we are focusing on three key areas: communication, resource management, and business continuity.\nWe have implemented new comprehensive protocols and practices, including remote work, social distancing, and enhanced equipment and facility cleaning, in line with guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and medical professionals partnering with industrial hygienists familiar with our operations.\nThese protocols are continuously updated as public experts provide new guidance.\nWe also formed a COVID-19 Planning and Communications task force, cancelled all non-essential business travel and in-person meetings, established contingency plans for staffing, and have been actively engaged company-wide to improve the content and frequency of our communications to ensure accurate and timely information flow about our operations, keeping our employees, customers, suppliers, and other stakeholders fully informed.\nOur operations teams have demonstrated remarkable agility, flexibility, and perseverance in maintaining smooth business operations.\nThey have taken timely and responsible measures to clean and disinfect facilities while carefully screening necessary third-party visitors to minimize COVID-19 exposure.\nFor colleagues typically working indoors in close proximity, we're using a combination of social distancing and work-from-home protocols.\nOur employees are diligently fulfilling their job responsibilities and remaining fully accessible.\nImportantly, whether working at an operating site, office, or remotely, our employees are empowered and encouraged to look out for each other.\nWith our team's safety ensured and employee engagement high, we can focus on our other stakeholders - customers, suppliers, creditors, shareholders, and communities - as we continue to run our essential business.\nJim will shortly discuss these results with you.\nI'd like to first express our pride in these results, which highlight our commitment to operational excellence and disciplined strategies.\nWhile we had a promising start to what we believed would be a record-setting 2020, we recognize this year will now be filled with unprecedented uncertainty as the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic and societal impacts continue to unfold.\nConsequently, despite our confidence in the fundamental strength and underlying drivers of our business, we have withdrawn our 2020 full-year guidance issued in February.\nWe haven't yet observed contractors and customers significantly delaying or canceling building projects.\nAlthough we typically don't comment on intra-quarter trends, these are unusual times.\nWe're making an exception and, as shown on our supplemental information slides 13 and 14, we're sharing preliminary April shipment and pricing trends to provide greater transparency about what we're seeing in a COVID-19-impacted month.\nSpecifically, for April, aggregate shipments remained high in most areas but didn't match the near-record April 2019 volumes.\nWe saw notable growth in North Texas, Colorado, and Indiana.\nCement shipments continue to be strong and are currently trending close to last year's levels.\nThe main exception is oil well cement shipments, as demand continues to decline due to volatile and historically low oil prices.\nReady-mixed concrete shipments are also trending near April 2019 levels, even as some homebuilders temporarily pause construction activity.\nApril revenues for the Magnesia Specialties business are $10 million lower than the same period last year.\nDemand for our lime and periclase products has significantly decreased as steel-producing customers temporarily closed their facilities in response to the COVID-19-induced shutdown of certain domestic auto manufacturers starting in mid-March.\nRegarding April pricing trends, aggregates pricing improved mid-single digits over April 2019 as announced increases were widely implemented earlier in the year.\nCement pricing is up, even with several competitors announcing plans to delay price increases until June 1.\nBefore the COVID-19 outbreak, we were very confident in achieving the full announced increase of $8 per ton implemented April 1, given strong market support in a tight Texas cement environment.\nReady-mixed concrete pricing is slightly higher than April 2019 levels.\nWe'll have a clearer picture of ready-mixed concrete pricing trends for the rest of the year as the phased reopening of the Texas and Colorado economies progresses.\nAlthough ours is a fundamental and resilient industry, it doesn't mean we're immune to the disruptions caused by the pandemic.\nMartin Marietta's economic performance may be affected by changes in consumer behavior or other industries due to the interconnected nature of the economy.\nWe expect product demand to decrease in the coming months, with private sector impacts occurring earlier than public sector effects.\nThe specifics of when, how long, and how severe the reduced demand will be are currently uncertain.\nInfrastructure projects, especially those involving highways and streets that require substantial aggregate use, are anticipated to be the most stable of the company's main business areas in the short term.\nMost state transportation departments remain active and continue to advertise and award contracts.\nHowever, we anticipate many state DOT budgets will face temporary challenges due to reduced revenue from fuel taxes, tolls, user fees, and other sources as much of the population has been under stay-at-home orders.\nThe effects of lower funding are expected to become more significant in the latter half of 2020, barring congressional action, and will differ considerably among states.\nFor instance, Florida's DOT has expedited over $2 billion worth of crucial transportation projects to take advantage of construction efficiencies resulting from reduced traffic, including closing additional lanes and increasing daytime work hours.\nTo address state DOT funding risks, industry representatives are actively engaging with Congress to include surface transportation in the fourth phase of COVID-19 emergency relief and economic recovery legislation.\nThe primary recommendation is a federal backstop of nearly $50 billion in immediate flexible funding to offset the estimated 30% loss in state transportation revenues over the next year and a half.\nThe second proposal is to pass a comprehensive major surface transportation reauthorization package.\nWe believe our industry is in a better position than in recent years to implement an infrastructure build due to the backlog of fully designed projects.\nOngoing nonresidential construction projects have generally continued in most areas.\nHowever, many commercial projects in the planning or engineering stages are being postponed or canceled, particularly in the office, retail, and hospitality sectors.\nSome industrial activities, conversely, are not expected to face significant near-term disruption from COVID-19, with warehouses, distribution centers, and data centers likely to perform relatively well in the current climate as businesses increase e-commerce operations, secure regional supply chains, and become more dependent on cloud and network services.\nSimilarly, major energy sector projects along Texas's Gulf Coast that are already in progress are expected to continue.\nThe residential market is anticipated to experience the quickest and perhaps steepest decline due to COVID-19 impacts, as unemployment and general economic instability cause home buyers and developers to delay plans.\nHowever, unlike the Great Recession, we do not expect a prolonged period of reduced residential activity.\nCurrent housing inventories remain near all-time lows despite significant population growth in Martin Marietta states and will benefit from historically low interest rates.\nAs we prepare for the secondary effects of the economic fallout from the Coronavirus, we rely on our values-driven culture.\nAs emphasized earlier, the safety, health, and well-being of our employees, customers, communities, and other stakeholders remains our highest priority.\nWith established protections in place to achieve this, we're focusing on our business priorities of generating cash flow, maintaining liquidity, and adjusting costs to align with product demand.\nOur team has developed comprehensive plans for various economic scenarios, and we're prepared to implement them promptly and with integrity as needed.\nIn addition to strengthening our balance sheet through a timely $500 million bond offering in early March, we've reduced non-essential expenses, cut capital spending for discretionary projects, and implemented hiring restrictions.\nWe're tightening our belts and aligning our capacity with demand in line with our commitment to being responsible stewards of shareholders' capital.\nWe will reassess these actions as visibility improves.\nHaving the right strategy, making appropriate decisions at the right time, and being able to execute them safely is crucial.\nMartin Marietta will do exactly that.\nWe're well-positioned geographically, financially, and otherwise to successfully navigate through today's unprecedented environment and emerge stronger and more capable.\nFirstly, Martin Marietta has a much stronger geographic and competitive position today compared to any previous downturn in our over 25 years as a public company.\nThis is significant, considering we navigated through the Great Recession while remaining profitable, never suspending or cutting dividends, and emerging with a healthy balance sheet.\nCurrently, we continue to generate record profitability on aggregate shipment levels much lower than our peak volumes in 2005, and with a geographic footprint that we've not only significantly expanded but also enhanced.\nFurthermore, we continue to carefully execute our strategic plans, strategically positioning our business through aggregates-led expansion in high-growth markets with attractive fundamentals and leveraging strategic cement and targeted downstream opportunities.\nThese strategic plans not only provide Martin Marietta with new growth platforms but also opportunities to expand our footprint to complement existing operations and build critical mass.\nWe now hold leading positions in 90% of our markets, up from 65% a decade ago, which supports favorable pricing trends, economies of scale, and cost flexibility.\nSecondly, we have experienced teams with decades of collective industry knowledge and expertise.\nTogether, their leadership and contributions have produced strong and sustained financial returns for Martin Marietta and our shareholders, as recently demonstrated by our one, five, and ten-year cumulative shareholder return performance.\nThis is largely the same leadership team that successfully formulated our operational response and prudently addressed our business needs during the Great Recession, the most challenging economic environment our industry has ever experienced.\nIn uncertain, evolving times, proven cycle-tested leadership and experience are crucial.\nIn summary, Martin Marietta has the right strategies, priorities, experience, and teams to responsibly guide us through these challenging times.\nI will briefly highlight our first quarter results and provide a summary of our financial and liquidity positions, both of which support our near- and long-term strategies.\nAs detailed in today's release, our first quarter financial and operational performance exceeded our expectations, particularly considering the record-setting prior year quarter that benefited from carryover work from an extraordinarily wet 2018.\nOn a consolidated basis, total revenues increased 2% to $958 million, a first quarter record.\nGross profit remained relatively stable.\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses improved by 10 basis points as a percentage of total revenues.\nDiluted earnings per share was $0.41, and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion, and amortization (adjusted EBITDA) decreased 6% to $149 million.\nThe Building Materials business achieved record first quarter revenues.\nProduct demand remains robust across our service areas, including in Texas and North Georgia where precipitation levels were exceptionally high.\nPrices for aggregates, cement and ready mixed concrete saw improvements, with all divisions contributing to robust growth, showcasing our market strength and effective local pricing strategies.\nThe Building Materials segment experienced a slight increase in gross profit.\nNotable points include: aggregates product gross profit decreased by $5 million, primarily due to updating inventory standard costs.\nOur per ton production costs have been decreasing over the past year as cost-saving measures and operational improvements take effect.\nUnder normal circumstances, this would lead to higher operating margins in the future.\nHowever, this quarter it resulted in a $4 million expense as we adjusted our inventory valuation to reflect the lower costs.\nIn comparison, during Q1 2019, we recorded an $11 million inventory valuation adjustment to account for higher production costs due to weather-related issues in 2018.\nWhile this total $15 million year-over-year inventory standard variance reduced quarterly product gross margin by 260 basis points, the lower unit production costs will provide benefits in the future.\nCement product gross margin increased by 1,170 basis points due to improved cost absorption from higher production levels and increased shipments to San Antonio, Austin, and Houston markets.\nPrice increases, along with reduced maintenance and energy costs, also contributed to the improved margin.\nThe ready mixed concrete business saw a $9 million decline in gross profit.\nPrice improvements and significant shipment growth in Colorado were outweighed by lower Texas volumes due to record rainfall delaying projects in the Dallas/Fort Worth area, as well as increased raw material costs.\nIn the Magnesia Specialties business, product revenues dropped 13% as expected, with chemicals customers continuing to reduce inventory levels for reasons unrelated to COVID-19.\nNotably, product gross margin improved by 500 basis points despite lower revenues, thanks to ongoing cost control measures and reduced energy costs.\nWe still believe the destocking trend among our chemicals customers will be temporary.\nOur consolidated results included several items affecting comparability with the previous year's quarter.\nFor clarity, we've included a slide in the Q1 2020 supplemental information on our website that shows a normalized view of pre-tax earnings with these items removed from both current and prior year quarters.\nIn addition to the aggregates inventory standard adjustments mentioned earlier, these items included $6 million in other nonoperating expenses to finance third-party railroad maintenance in exchange for a federal income tax benefit of about $7 million, which led to the low income tax rate for Q1 2020.\nWe also incurred a $2 million non-cash expense to implement a new paid time-off policy for our employees.\nAs shown on slide five, first quarter 2020 earnings before income tax, excluding items affecting comparability, improved by $15 million.\nNow, let's discuss our capital structure.\nMartin Marietta has historically operated with a growth-oriented approach while maintaining a strong balance sheet to preserve financial flexibility.\nAs a result, we have sufficient liquidity for the foreseeable future.\nIn the current environment, this is a highly advantageous position.\nWe will continue to balance our long-standing, disciplined capital allocation priorities to maintain this flexibility.\nOur priorities remain focused on value-enhancing acquisitions, prudent organic capital investment, and opportunistic returns of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, while maintaining our investment-grade credit rating.\nOur strategy aims to ensure our cash flows are adequate for a range of scenarios.\nIn today's uncertain climate, this range of scenarios is broader, and actions to enhance cash flows and maintain liquidity are even more crucial.\nBefore the full extent of the economic disruption became clear, we repurchased 211,000 shares in the first quarter.\nSince then, we have temporarily suspended share repurchases.\nWe will continue to monitor the situation closely and reassess this pause in our share repurchase program as circumstances evolve.\nTo further boost cash flows, as Ward mentioned, we are reducing capital spending on discretionary projects.\nWe now estimate full-year capital expenditures will be between $325 million and $350 million, down from our original guidance of $425 million to $475 million.\nWe demonstrated our ability to reduce capital spending safely and prudently without long-term damage to the business during the Great Recession, and we are doing so again now as appropriate.\nWe strengthened the company's balance sheet and cash position with our timely bond offering in early March, issuing $500 million of 10-year senior notes at a 2.5% coupon.\nProceeds will be used to repay the $300 million of floating rate notes maturing later this month, with most of the remaining cash retained on the balance sheet.\nLooking ahead, as shown in our supplemental information slides, after the May repayment, we will have no additional bond maturities for over four years.\nWe are confident in our liquidity position.\nNet cash, combined with nearly $760 million available on our existing revolving facilities, provided total liquidity of approximately $880 million at the end of the quarter.\nAdditionally, with a net debt to consolidated adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.3 times, we remain well within our target leverage ratio of 2 to 2.5 times at the end of the first quarter.\nIn conclusion, we are pleased with our solid first quarter performance and improved liquidity.\nRegarding our 2020 full-year guidance, we will reinstate earnings guidance once we have sufficient visibility to do so.\nNevertheless, we remain confident that the attractive underlying market fundamentals and long-term secular growth trends in our key geographies, which underpinned the company's record 2019 performance and strong first quarter 2020 results, remain intact and will become evident again as the U.S. economy stabilizes and recovers.\nMartin Marietta is well-positioned geographically, financially, and otherwise to responsibly navigate the current extraordinary environment and drive sustainable long-term growth and shareholder value as we move forward.\nWe have thoughtfully developed and consistently executed our strategic plans, positioning our business as an aggregates leader in attractive high-growth areas, aligning our product offerings to leverage strategic cement and targeted downstream opportunities, and prudently allocating capital while maintaining financial flexibility.\nIn doing so, we have built a business that is durable, resilient, and stronger than ever.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Today, Ward and I will commence the earnings call by discussing our annual operational performance.\nFollowing that, Jim Nickolas will present our financial outcomes and liquidity status for 2020, after which Ward will address market trends and our projections for 2021.\nSubsequently, we will open the floor for questions and answers.\nWe earnestly wish for the continued safety and well-being of you and your loved ones.\nThe year 2020 was undoubtedly exceptional for Martin Marietta by all measures.\nWe take pride in maintaining our longstanding record of financial, operational, and safety excellence, especially during a year marked by unprecedented challenges.\nMartin Marietta achieved new performance milestones, delivering our most lucrative year and the best safety record in our company's history.\nThese remarkable outcomes showcase our resilient business model and our team's dedication to Martin Marietta's vision, as well as the successful implementation of our proven strategic operating analysis and review plan.\nAs mentioned, our discussion today will concentrate on our full-year results and outlook for 2021.\nBefore delving into that, I'll highlight a few significant takeaways from our record-breaking fourth quarter.\nNotably, we experienced solid growth in shipments and pricing across all product lines as construction activity stabilized following the spring and summer months when COVID-19 had a more significant impact.\nThese improvements in top-line performance, combined with our unwavering focus on cost management, led to a 7% increase in consolidated total revenues, a 20% growth in adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (adjusted EBITDA), and a 40% rise in diluted earnings per share.\nFor the entire year, we established new records in products and services revenues, profitability, and adjusted EBITDA.\nSpecifically, full-year consolidated products and services revenues rose to $4.4 billion.\nConsolidated gross profit saw a 6% increase to $1.3 billion.\nAdjusted EBITDA grew by 11% to nearly $1.4 billion, and diluted earnings per share reached $11.54, an 18% improvement.\nMartin Marietta's 2020 results marked the ninth consecutive year of growth in these financial metrics.\nOperating our business safely forms the foundation of our long-standing financial success.\nMartin Marietta's industry-leading safety performance continues to trend near or surpass world-class safety levels.\nWe achieved a 25% reduction in total reportable incidents across the enterprise in 2020, and for the fourth consecutive year, we maintained a company-wide world-class lost-time incident rate.\nThese outstanding financial and safety results are directly attributable to the dedication and adaptability of our nearly 9,000 talented employees.\nI'm immensely proud of how our team managed the challenges and disruptions caused by the pandemic while remaining focused on being good teammates, working safely and efficiently together, and seamlessly meeting our diverse stakeholders' needs.\nWith that overview, let's now examine our full-year operating performance.\nAggregate shipments decreased by 2% to nearly 187 million tons, reflecting anticipated lower infrastructure shipments in parts of North Carolina, reduced energy sector demand, and challenges from COVID-19 disruptions.\nHowever, in line with broader macroeconomic trends, full-year aggregate shipments to the residential market increased, benefiting from robust single-family housing activity.\nAggregates average selling price rose by 4% on a mix-adjusted basis, aligning with our expectations.\nNotably, all divisions contributed to this solid growth, demonstrating this product line's resilient pricing power and our leading market positions in attractive geographies.\nThe disciplined execution of our locally driven pricing strategy, along with favorable underlying market fundamentals, will continue to support sustainable pricing growth moving forward.\nOur cement operations set new records for shipments, which increased by 2% to nearly four million tons.\nLarge project activity supported underlying product demand in both North and South Texas throughout the year, offsetting weakness in the energy sector.\nPricing increased by 3% on a mix-adjusted basis, demonstrating the resilient price fundamentals of core products in the state of Texas.\nWe anticipate our cement business will continue to benefit from favorable shipment and pricing trends, supported by tight supply and healthy demand in Texas, diversified customer backlogs, and April 2021 price increases.\nRegarding our targeted downstream businesses, ready-mixed concrete shipments increased by 3%, excluding shipments from acquired operations and from our Southwest division's former concrete business in Arkansas, Louisiana, and Eastern Texas, which we divested in January 2020.\nConcrete pricing increased by 2%.\nOur Colorado asphalt and paving division set a new record for asphalt deliveries, with a 15% increase to 3 million tons.\nThis increase was due to strong product demand and leftover work from weather-related delays in 2019.\nThe price of asphalt went up by almost 3%.\nWe finished 2020 with the best full-year adjusted EBITDA margin in Martin Marietta's history.\nOur Building Materials division led this achievement, delivering record revenues of $4.2 billion for products and services, a 1% increase, and record product gross profit of $1.2 billion, a 7% increase.\nOur primary materials businesses, specifically aggregates and cement, set all-time records for both annual product revenues and gross profit.\nThe product gross margin for aggregates improved by 130 basis points to a record 30.6%, and unit profitability grew by 8%.\nThese results, stemming from strong pricing, careful cost management, and reduced diesel expenses, showcase the cost flexibility and resilience of our aggregates-focused business.\nThe Cement division benefited from the scheduled kiln maintenance that took place at the end of 2019.\nThis maintenance timing resulted in some costs being recorded in 2019 instead of early 2020.\nMore significantly, this and other capital improvements have greatly enhanced our cement operations.\nWe reached 90% kiln reliability this year, up from 82% in 2019, which allowed for increased production and better fixed cost absorption at our Midlothian and Hunter facilities.\nThese factors, along with pricing strength adjusted for product mix and lower fuel costs, contributed to the 510 basis point improvement in cement product gross margin to 37.8%.\nOur specialized downstream businesses also produced solid annual financial results.\nReady mixed concrete product gross margin rose by 10 basis points to 8.4% as price increases offset higher raw material costs.\nAsphalt and paving achieved a gross profit of $60 million and a 100 basis point improvement in gross margin, driven by double-digit revenue growth.\nOur Magnesia Specialties division returned to revenue and profitability growth in the fourth quarter.\nThe 12% revenue increase in the quarter wasn't enough to compensate for demand declines earlier in the year.\nAs a result, annual product revenues decreased by 12% to $221 million.\nWe expect the fourth quarter strength in chemical demand to continue in 2021, as steel production has recovered from last summer's COVID-19-induced low and our cobalt customers resume operations.\nRemarkably, product gross margin improved by 80 basis points to 40.6% due to our proactive cost control measures in response to lower shipments.\nShifting focus to cash generation, capital allocation, and liquidity.\nMartin Marietta ended 2020 with the highest cash generation in our history.\nOperating cash flow of $1.05 billion increased by 9%, driven by earnings growth.\nWe continue to balance our long-standing disciplined capital allocation priorities to responsibly grow our business while maintaining a strong balance sheet and preserving financial flexibility to further increase shareholder value.\nOur priorities remain focused on value-enhancing acquisitions, prudent organic capital investment, and consistent return of capital to shareholders while maintaining our investment-grade credit rating.\nIn 2020, we invested $360 million of capital into our business and returned $190 million to shareholders through both an increased dividend and the first quarter repurchase of 211,000 shares of our common stock.\nIn August 2020, our Board approved a 4% increase in our quarterly cash dividend, demonstrating its continued confidence in our future performance and maintaining Martin Marietta's history of dividend growth.\nSince announcing our repurchase authorization in February 2015, we have returned over $1.8 billion to shareholders through a combination of significant and sustainable dividends and share repurchases.\nWe concluded 2020 with a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.9 times, slightly below our target leverage range of 2 to 2.5 times, providing us the flexibility to pursue profitable investment opportunities.\nOur robust balance sheet, combined with $1.1 billion available on our credit facilities, provides Martin Marietta with the financial strength to respond to and execute on disciplined capital allocation priorities and continue growing our business profitably.\nLooking forward, we believe 2021 will see a return to more normal conditions as underlying demand fundamentals reset and the nation's economy regains momentum.\nWe remain confident in Martin Marietta's attractive business drivers and are encouraged by accelerating long-term trends across our three primary end-use markets and key geographic areas.\nWe anticipate these trends will drive construction-led, aggregates-intensive growth.\nInfrastructure activity, especially for aggregates-intensive highways, roads, and streets, continues to show resilience.\nThe one-year extension of the FAST Act at current funding levels provides state and local governments with the necessary visibility to plan, design, and award transportation projects for the 2021 construction season\nProjected fiscal 2021 lettings for our top five departments of transportation are currently at or above previous year levels\nOur top five states - Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia, and Florida - are particularly significant, accounting for 71% of our 2020 Building Materials business total revenues\nDOTs recently received almost $10 billion in targeted relief as part of the December 2020 Coronavirus Response and Relief Act to help offset pandemic-related transportation revenue shortfalls\nThis financial assistance does not require state matching funds\nAccording to initial estimates, over $2 billion of this aid will be allocated to Martin Marietta's top five states\nIn the medium to long term, we expect voter-approved state and local transportation measures and the passage of a comprehensive federal transportation program to promote multi-year growth in product demand\nIn November 2020, voters demonstrated strong support for state and local transportation investment, approving 94% of ballot measures, the highest approval rating ever\nThese initiatives are expected to generate an additional $14 billion in one-time and recurring transportation funding, with 82% of that in Texas, our top revenue-generating state\nThere is bipartisan support for new surface transportation legislation aimed at increasing funding to levels not seen in over 15 years, with both the House of Representatives and Senate previously advancing proposed bills\nWe believe the 117th Congress creates an opportunity to advance a significant increase in funding over the FAST Act\nWe're optimistic that an agreement on a new bill could be reached this summer, generating substantial benefits in 2022 and beyond\nWe anticipate increased infrastructure investment to provide volume stability and drive aggregate shipments in that end-use closer to our 10-year historical average of 43% of our total shipments\nFor context, aggregate shipments to the infrastructure market made up 36% of 2020 shipments\nNonresidential construction is expected to continue benefiting from growing e-commerce and remote work trends, which require increased investment in large industrial warehouses and data centers, particularly in our key metropolitan areas\nThis type of construction tends to be more aggregates-intensive than light commercial construction due to the projects' size, scale, and structure\nLight commercial and retail construction will remain relatively challenged until COVID-19 vaccines are more widely distributed\nIn the long term, light nonresidential activity will benefit from the positive effects of strong single-family residential trends\nAggregate shipments to the nonresidential market accounted for 34% of 2020 shipments\nSingle-family housing is set for multi-year growth, returning to more normal levels during this economic cycle\nWe believe Martin Marietta's strong presence in the southeastern and southwestern regions positions the company to benefit significantly from these trends, given underbuilt conditions, favorable population and employment dynamics, land availability, mild climates, and lower cost of living in these areas\nSingle-family housing requires two to three times more aggregates than multifamily construction, due to the additional nonresidential and infrastructure needs of new suburban communities\nAggregates for the residential market made up 24% of 2020 shipments\nWe are confident in the fundamental strength and underlying drivers of our business\nAs stated in today's release, we have resumed providing full-year annual guidance\nWe currently expect 2021 aggregates shipment growth to range from 1% to 4%, reflecting single-family housing strength, expanded infrastructure investment, and large-scale heavy industrial projects that will support our near-term shipment levels\nWe remain confident that our favorable pricing trends are sustainable, supported by improved contractor confidence and healthy customer backlogs\nFor 2021, we expect annual aggregates price increases, effective from January 1 to April 1, to rise in a range of 3% to 5%\nIncluding contributions from our Cement, Downstream, and Magnesia Specialties businesses, we expect consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $1.350 billion to $1.450 billion\nWhen comparing this guidance range to the previous year, we're not anticipating the same level of nonrecurring gains from land sales and divested surplus assets as seen in 2020\nWe're proud of our 2020 record financial results and industry-leading safety performance\nWe're also very optimistic about our future\nDue to our efforts over the past few years, Martin Marietta is uniquely positioned to capitalize on emerging growth trends expected to support steady and sustainable construction activity in the long term\nThe disciplined execution of our strategic plan, combined with our pricing discipline, operational excellence, prudent capital allocation, and adherence to robust health protocols, will continue to strengthen Martin Marietta's solid foundation for lasting success\nAs we move forward, we have the resources, team, and capabilities to drive value-enhancing growth\nWe're confident in Martin Marietta's ability to build on our successful track record of strong financial, operational, and safety performance, and remain focused on delivering superior returns for investors while meeting and exceeding our commitments to other stakeholders, including customers, employees, and communities\nSummary: ",
    "output": "martin marietta materials inc - qtrly total revenue $1,179.6 million versus $1,100.4 million.\nmartin marietta materials inc - remains well-positioned to capitalize on emerging demand in 2021 and beyond.\n"

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Mike Hennigan, CEO, Maryann Mannen, CFO, and other executive team members are participating in today's call.\nWe encourage you to review the safe harbor statements on Slide 2.\nResults may vary from what is presented.\nWe'd like to provide a quick update on the business before delving into our quarterly results.\nIn Q2, we observed gradual demand increases for our products as COVID vaccination rollouts and eased mobility restrictions led to more economic activity and higher transportation fuel demand.\nHowever, we're nearing the end of the summer driving season, typically our strongest period of the year.\nCurrent gasoline demand is 2% to 5% lower than 2019 levels, with the West Coast lagging further at about 10% below.\nDiesel demand remains steady, matching 2019 levels.\nDespite rising personal passenger traffic, we continue to observe a lack of long-distance international flights and business travel.\nOverall, jet fuel demand remains approximately 30% below pre-pandemic levels.\nThe complete recovery of aviation fuel demand will likely take more time, especially considering the recent surge in COVID-19 variants.\nAs we enter the latter half of the year, we remain cautiously optimistic about the recovery and will continue to focus on aspects of our business within our control.\nSlide 4 showcases our progress on strategic priorities for the quarter.\nOn May 14, we finalized the sale of our Speedway business to 7-Eleven.\nWe announced plans to return $10 billion from the sale proceeds to shareholders through share buybacks.\nTo swiftly return capital, we immediately initiated a modified Dutch auction tender offer, repurchasing nearly $1 billion worth of shares.\nWe're continuing to restructure our portfolio.\nDickinson reached its full design capacity this quarter.\nWith an annual output of approximately 180 million gallons, Dickinson is the second-largest renewable diesel facility in the United States.\nWe're advancing detailed engineering and permitting at Martinez to convert the oil refinery into a renewable diesel facility.\nBased on our progress and discussions with feedstock suppliers, we're confident in our timeline to start producing renewable diesel in the second half of 2022, with an initial capacity of about 260 million gallons per year.\nWe expect to reach full capacity of approximately 730 million gallons per year by the end of 2023.\nWe maintain a strong focus on cost and capital management in our challenging commodity business, as being a low-cost operator ensures our competitiveness.\nWe've continued to scrutinize all aspects of spending, resulting in additional progress.\nOur operating results for the first half of 2021 reflect our aim to reduce overall refining cost structure by $1 billion.\nNotably, we published our two annual ESG-related reports in June.\nOur sustainability report provides a comprehensive look at the company's sustainability approach and performance, aligning with SASB and GRI reporting guidelines.\nOur perspectives on climate-related scenarios follow TCFD guidance and analyze the company's resilience relative to climate scenarios proposed by the IEA.\nSlide 5 outlines some ways we're challenging ourselves to lead in sustainable energy.\nStrategically, we aim to balance current needs while investing in a sustainable, energy-diverse future.\nThis includes enhancing resilience by reducing our carbon intensity and conserving natural resources, planning for the future by investing in renewables and emerging technologies, and integrating sustainability into decision-making across all aspects of engagement with our people and stakeholders.\nWe have three well-known companywide targets.\nFirst, reducing our Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions intensity by 30% by 2030.\nSecond, decreasing midstream methane intensity by 50% by 2025.\nLastly, reducing our fresh water withdrawal intensity by 20% by 2030.\nThe changing energy landscape presents significant opportunities for innovation.\nWe've allocated 40% of our 2021 growth capital to advance two major renewable fuels projects.\nIn late 2020, we began renewable diesel production at our Dickinson, North Dakota facility, the second-largest of its kind in the United States, and are progressing with the conversion of our Martinez, California refinery to a renewable diesel facility.\nTo showcase our commitment to integrating sustainability across all levels of our organization, we tie a portion of executive and employee bonuses to an ESG-related metric.\nWe recently became the first U.S. independent downstream company to incorporate both diversity, equity, and inclusion goals and greenhouse gas intensity reduction targets into our compensation structure.\nMaintaining safety in our operations is crucial for sustainable business practices.\nOur teams achieved impressive safety and environmental results in 2020, including significant reductions in serious process safety incidents and environmental issues compared to the previous year.\nWe continue to outperform industry standards for personal safety in the U.S. refining and midstream sectors.\nThe sixth slide presents an overview of our financial performance for the second quarter.\nOur adjusted EBITDA for the quarter totaled $2.194 billion.\nThis figure encompasses results from both ongoing and discontinued operations.\nCash flow from continuing operations, excluding working capital changes, reached $1.535 billion, marking a roughly $1 billion increase from the previous quarter.\nFor the first time in almost a year and a half, our ongoing operating cash flow exceeded our business needs, capital commitments, and covered both dividends and distributions.\nWe returned approximately $1.4 billion to shareholders this quarter through dividend payments and share buybacks.\nThe completion of the Speedway sale represents a significant step in our ongoing efforts to enhance our portfolio's competitive position.\nWe'd like to highlight some key points about the sale on Slide 7.\nThe total proceeds from the Speedway sale amounted to $21 billion.\nBased on our tax basis, our cash tax liability, both current and deferred, will be around $4.2 billion, which is lower than our initial estimate of $4.5 billion.\nThis amount has been accounted for on our balance sheet.\nAdditionally, there were closing adjustments of about $400 million.\nConsequently, the after-tax proceeds from the sale will total $17.2 billion.\nIt's worth noting that this figure exceeds our initial projection of $16.5 billion.\nSlide 8 outlines how we plan to use the proceeds from the sale.\nSince finalizing the transaction, we have reduced our structural debt by $2.5 billion and repurchased approximately $1 billion in stock.\nWe didn't buy back additional shares during the post-tender period due to regulatory restrictions, including a mandatory cooling-off period and our routine quarterly blackout period before earnings announcements.\nHowever, this temporary pause in repurchases doesn't indicate any change in our commitment to complete the buyback within 12 to 16 months.\nIn line with this commitment, as Mike mentioned earlier, we are initiating the next phase to complete the remaining $9 billion capital return.\nSpecifically, we're launching an open-market repurchase program that will allow us to buy shares over an extended period, even when we may possess information that would normally prevent us from trading. We will provide updates on our progress during earnings calls.\nSlide 9 demonstrates the progress we've made in reducing our cost structure.\nSince the start of 2020, we've significantly lowered our refining operating costs and decreased our overall cost profile by about $1 billion.\nWhile there are quarter-to-quarter fluctuations, our refining operating costs have decreased from $6 per barrel at the beginning of 2020 to an average of roughly $5 per barrel in 2021.\nWe've applied the same cost-cutting approach to our corporate expenses.\nAlthough corporate costs may vary from quarter to quarter, we believe we've reduced our overall cost structure by more than $100 million, and we continually seek new ways to cut expenses.\nNatural gas, a variable cost in refinery operations, has recently increased by nearly $1 per MMBtu, which we expect to be a challenge in the third quarter.\nWhile our results reflect our focus on cost management, we remain committed to safely operating our assets and protecting the health and safety of our employees, customers, and communities.\nAs we've previously stated, our cost reductions are designed to be sustainable, avoid impacting revenue opportunities, and never compromise the safety of our people or operations.\nSlide 10 provides a reconciliation from net income to adjusted EBITDA and shows the quarter-over-quarter change in adjusted EBITDA from Q1 2021 to Q2 2021.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased by over $600 million compared to the previous quarter, primarily driven by improvements in refining and marketing.\nAs mentioned earlier, this quarter's results include the effects of finalizing the Speedway sale.\nIn this section, the $11.7 billion pre-tax profit from the sale is shown in the adjustments column as $11.6 billion, which includes other adjustments of $79 million for impairment and transaction-related expenses.\nThe $3.7 billion financial tax provision represents the combined effect of cash taxes and deferred tax impact.\nThe $8 billion profit from the sale is included in our quarterly net income.\nSlide 18 in our appendix details the specific effects of the Speedway sale across the three financial statements.\nLet's move on to our segment results.\nSlide 11 gives a summary of our refining and marketing segment.\nThe division reported positive EBITDA for the second consecutive quarter since the COVID pandemic began, with adjusted EBITDA of $751 million.\nThis was a $728 million improvement compared to the first quarter of 2021.\nThe improvement was mainly due to higher refining margins, particularly in the Mid-Con region where cracks improved by 57% from the first quarter.\nHigher utilization also contributed to the improved results, reaching 94% for the second quarter compared to 83% in the first quarter.\nIt's worth noting that we shut down two high-cost refineries in 2020.\nIf adjusted to include that idled capacity from 2020, utilization would have been about 78% in the first quarter of '21 and subsequently rose to 89% in the second quarter of '21.\nOperating costs remained relatively stable compared to the previous quarter despite increased utilization, demonstrating the team's commitment to cost control despite rising variable expenses.\nSlide 12 illustrates the change in our midstream EBITDA compared to the first quarter of 2021.\nOur midstream segment continues to show earnings resilience and stability with results similar to the previous quarter.\nOnce again, the team is making excellent progress in executing strategic priorities of strict capital discipline, reducing cost structure, and optimizing the portfolio.\nBy the end of 2021, we estimate that MPLX will have reduced their structural costs by $300 million.\nSlide 13 shows the factors affecting our consolidated cash position for the second quarter.\nIt includes both our continuing and discontinued operations.\nWe have specifically highlighted items related to the Speedway closure.\nWithin continuing operations, operating cash flow before working capital changes was $1.5 billion in the quarter.\nChanges in working capital were neutral this quarter.\nRising crude prices provided a source of over $500 million, which was mostly offset by the large receivable balance with Speedway becoming a third-party customer and typical seasonal refined product inventory increases.\nDuring the quarter, MPC reduced debt by $3.3 billion.\nAdditionally, MPLX decreased third-party debt by about $800 million during the quarter.\nRegarding capital return, MPC paid $380 million to shareholders through dividends and bought back $981 million worth of shares using Speedway proceeds.\nAt the end of the quarter, MPC had $17.3 billion in cash and higher-yielding short-term investments, such as commercial paper and certificates of deposit.\nOn Slide 14, we provide our third-quarter outlook.\nWe anticipate total throughput volumes of approximately 2.8 million barrels per day.\nPlanned turnaround costs are expected to be about $195 million in the third quarter.\nMost of the activity will be at our Robinson and Mandan refineries in the Mid-Con region.\nAs previously mentioned, our turnaround activity is concentrated in the second half of this year.\nOther operating expenses are scheduled to occur during these periods as well.\nThis is reflected in our projected cost trends for the third quarter.\nTotal operating costs are expected to be $5.05 per barrel for the quarter.\nDistribution costs are anticipated to be approximately $1.3 billion for the quarter.\nCorporate costs are expected to be $175 million, consistent with the second quarter and reflecting the approximately $100 million in costs that have been removed on an annual basis.\nWe are ready for additional questions.\nWe will now open the call for questions.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Gregory and Jason will examine our findings with commentary, while Jack and Kelly will participate in the question and answer session.\nThese documents contain reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures for your convenience.\nThese assertions are founded on present-day expectations and presumptions that may be affected by various risks and ambiguities.\nDetails regarding factors that might cause such discrepancies can be found in today's earnings announcement, in the remarks made during this call, in the Risk Factors portion of our 2020 annual report on Form 10-K, and in our other reports and submissions to the SEC.\nI'll begin by offering some thoughts on the overall business before Jason delves into our results and outlook.\nThe first quarter was exceptional.\nWe set Q1 records for revenue, operating profit, and cash flow.\nWe improved operating margins by 220 basis points and concluded the quarter with a backlog of $11.3 billion, an 8% increase from last year.\nMoreover, demand remains robust, resulting in the highest first-quarter orders in our company's history.\nOur Software and Services division had another remarkable quarter and continues to propel revenue growth and operating margin expansion.\nQuarterly sales increased by 15%, driven by growth across our LMR, video security, and command center software technologies.\nThe division also ended with operating margins 310 basis points higher than the previous year.\nBased on the heightened demand we're observing across our business and our strong backlog position, we're increasing our full-year guidance for both sales and earnings per share.\nOur Q1 results included $1.8 billion in revenue, a 7% increase, including $48 million from acquisitions and $32 million from favorable currency exchange rates.\nGAAP operating earnings were $298 million, with operating margins at 16.8% of sales, compared to 15.6% in the same quarter last year.\nNon-GAAP operating earnings were $411 million, up $64 million or 18%, with non-GAAP operating margins at 23.2% of sales, up from 21%, driven by higher sales and improved operating leverage in both segments.\nGAAP earnings per share were $1.41, compared to $1.12 in the same quarter last year.\nThe increase was mainly due to higher sales volume, improved operating leverage, and lower legal fees, partially offset by the gain from selling a manufacturing facility recognized in the previous year.\nNon-GAAP earnings per share were $1.87, compared to $1.49 last year, primarily due to higher sales and improved operating leverage in both segments, higher pension income, and a lower diluted share count, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate.\nOperating expenses in Q1 were $455 million, up $4 million from last year, primarily due to acquisition-related costs, partially offset by lower discretionary spending.\nRegarding cash flow, our Q1 operating cash flow was $370 million, compared to $308 million in the prior year, and free cash flow was $318 million, compared to $260 million in the prior year.\nThe increase in cash flow was mainly due to higher sales and improved working capital, partially offset by higher cash taxes.\nCapital allocation for Q1 included $170 million in share repurchases at an average price of $175.53, $121 million in cash dividends, and $52 million in capital expenditures.\nDuring the quarter, we entered into a new five-year $2.25 billion revolving credit facility, replacing our previous $2.2 billion facility.\nAfter the quarter ended, the Board of Directors approved a $2 billion increase to the share repurchase program.\nLet's examine our segment outcomes.\nIn the first quarter, Products and Systems Integration revenue reached $1 billion, increasing by 2%. This growth was mainly due to increased sales in video security and professional and commercial radio, which was partly counterbalanced by reduced sales in public safety LMR due to supply limitations.\nThe quarter saw $35 million in revenue from acquisitions.\nOperating profits were $131 million, representing 12.9% of sales, an increase from 12.4% the previous year, attributed to higher sales and improved efficiency.\nKey achievements in Q1 for this segment include a $300 million agreement with the German MOD for TETRA LMR needs, with an initial $154 million order recorded.\nGovernment customers' video sales totaled $72 million, a 32% increase from the previous year.\nA Canadian government agency placed a $37 million order for a P25 upgrade.\nA major European customer ordered a $33 million TETRA upgrade.\nA large U.S. federal customer placed a $12 million P25 order.\nTurning to the Software and Services segment.\nFirst quarter revenue was $758 million, a 15% increase from last year, driven by growth in LMR services, video security, and command center software.\nAcquisitions contributed $13 million to the quarter's revenue.\nOperating profits reached $280 million, or 36.9% of sales, an increase of 310 basis points from last year, due to increased sales, higher gross margins, and improved efficiency.\nNotable Q1 wins in this segment include over $40 million in orders for P25 services, upgrades, and body-worn cameras from Nashville, Tennessee.\nA large U.S. customer signed a $35 million multi-year contract for push-to-talk over broadband.\nA major Middle Eastern customer placed a $22 million order for P25 and push-to-talk over broadband.\nMultiple U.K. customers ordered $13 million worth of body-worn cameras.\nWe secured our largest cloud-based command center software contract to date, a $5 million deal with St. Lucie, Florida.\nWe also announced a new integration between our V300 body-worn camera and APX P25 radio platform.\nExamining our regional performance.\nNorth American Q1 revenue was $1.2 billion, up 6% due to growth in LMR, video security, and command center software.\nInternational Q1 revenue reached $588 million, a 9% increase, with growth in EMEA, Asia Pacific, and Latin America, primarily in video security and LMR.\nRegarding our backlog.\nEnd-of-quarter backlog set a Q1 record at $11.3 billion, an $866 million increase from last year, with $639 million growth in North America and $227 million internationally.\nCompared to the previous quarter, backlog decreased by $130 million, mainly due to revenue recognition on Airwave and ESN contracts, partially offset by international growth in LMR products.\nSoftware and Services backlog grew by $548 million year-over-year, with $491 million growth in multi-year LMR services and command center software contracts in North America, and $58 million in international software growth.\nThe positive impact of foreign exchange on backlog was balanced out by revenue recognition for Airwave and ESN.\nThe backlog decreased by $269 million sequentially, primarily due to revenue recognition for Airwave and ESN\nProducts and SI backlog increased by $318 million compared to the previous year\nThis was mainly caused by LMR growth in both regions\nThe backlog rose by $139 million sequentially, attributed to international LMR growth\nLet's discuss our future projections\nWe anticipate Q2 sales to increase by 19% to 20%, with non-GAAP earnings per share ranging from $1.90 to $1.95\nThis projection assumes current FX spot rates, a weighted average diluted share count of about 173 million, and an effective tax rate between 23% and 24%\nFor the full year, we now project sales growth of 8% to 9%, up from our earlier forecast of 7.25% to 8%\nWe expect full year non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $8.70 and $8.80, an increase from our previous guidance of $8.50 to $8.62\nThis updated outlook takes into account ongoing supply chain constraints, mainly in LMR products, and assumes current FX spot rates, a weighted average diluted share count of 173 million, and an effective tax rate of 22.5% to 23%\nI'd like to conclude with some observations about the business\nTo begin with, our quarterly results were exceptional\nWe achieved record Q1 sales, orders, operating earnings, and cash flow\nWe improved both gross and operating margins, saw double-digit growth in video security, command center software, and LMR services, and our PCR business returned to growth\nMoreover, we ended the quarter with a record Q1 backlog and sustained strong demand, which we expect will drive growth for the rest of the year, despite the supply challenges we face\nWe also announced today that the Board has approved a $2 billion increase to our share repurchase program\nSecondly, demand for our video security business is exceptionally strong\nWe now expect full-year growth to exceed 20%, up from the high teens we mentioned in our previous call\nIn fixed video, which accounts for about 70% of total video security revenue, our investments in AI analytics, cloud services, access control, and NDAA-compliant manufacturing are setting us apart from competitors and driving growth faster than the overall market\nIn mobile video, the call for increased transparency is driving growth for our purpose-built body-worn and in-car camera solutions, and we're gaining market share in an area previously dominated by a single vendor\nDuring the quarter, we secured several large body-worn camera contracts, both in the U.S. and internationally\nAdditionally, we announced two new offerings: the integration of our V300 body-worn camera with our APX P25 radios, allowing us to leverage our market-leading LMR installed base, and our $49 per month body-worn camera as a service offering, providing affordable access to a video solution fully integrated with our command central software suite for every U.S. police agency\nLastly, I'm very satisfied with our progress in leveraging our leading LMR installed base to expand into command center software, video security, and LMR services\nCurrently, almost half of our revenue comes from these higher-growth areas, up from 20% five years ago, and our addressable market has tripled during that time\nWhile we've made significant progress, I firmly believe we still have substantial room for growth as we continue to invest capital, both organically and inorganically, in these areas to drive revenue, margin, and cash flow for the company\nOperator, could you please remind our callers how to ask a question?\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:The financial report includes certain non-GAAP financial measures.\nLet's examine our fiscal 2022 second quarter results.\nWe are satisfied with our financial results for the quarter.\nVisitor numbers and demand for our resort experiences remain positive, especially among destination guests, with improvements seen after the holiday season as conditions got better, more skiing areas opened, and the impact of the COVID-19 Omicron variant decreased.\nAs anticipated, this quarter's results significantly surpassed those of the previous year due to the greater impact of COVID-19 and related restrictions during that time.\nThe 2021/2022 North American ski season had a sluggish beginning.\nThe combination of weather patterns, workforce issues, and the surge in Omicron variant cases created difficulties during the holiday period, affecting our resorts' ability to open all terrain as planned and negatively impacting guest experiences.\nDespite various preparations made before the season, including wage increases, staffing levels were below target at the start of the holiday season, mirroring challenges faced by the broader travel and leisure industry at that time.\nDuring the holiday period, COVID-19 cases linked to the Omicron variant rose dramatically, affecting both travel plans and staff availability, despite having a vaccinated workforce.\nAt certain resorts, over 10% of our employees were unable to work due to COVID-19 at one point.\nTo address these issues, the company raised hourly wages during the holidays and for the remainder of the ski season, costing $20 million in fiscal 2022.\nAfter the holiday period, conditions at our resorts improved significantly with better snowfall, stabilization and eventual reduction in COVID-19 cases, and improved staffing, allowing us to open terrain across our resorts close to normal levels for that time of year.\nSki resorts surpassed our expectations, particularly in January.\nAs expected, Whistler Blackcomb was disproportionately affected by COVID-19-related travel restrictions, resulting in challenging outcomes for U.S. destinations and international visits to the resort.\nExcluding the Seven Springs Resorts, total visits for the quarter increased by 2% compared to the second fiscal quarter of 2020.\nCompared to the second fiscal quarter of 2020, our ancillary business lines experienced revenue declines, especially in food and beverage, which was significantly impacted by numerous COVID-19-related operational restrictions and overall staffing challenges.\nResort net revenue for the second fiscal quarter of 2022 decreased by 2% compared to the same period in fiscal year 2020, mainly due to challenges in our ancillary business lines and approximately $33 million in pass revenue that would have been recognized in the second fiscal quarter of 2022 but was deferred to the third quarter because of delayed openings at several of our resorts.\nOur lodging business performed well during the quarter, with average daily rates exceeding expectations, partially offset by lower-than-anticipated occupancy rates during the early season.\nCompared to the second fiscal quarter of 2020, resort reported EBITDA increased by 5% despite challenging early season conditions and COVID-19-related issues.\nThe resort reported EBITDA margin for the second quarter was 43.9%, an increase from 40.9% in the second quarter of fiscal 2020.\nAs Kirsten mentioned, we are pleased with our performance for the quarter, especially considering the slow start to the season.\nNet income attributable to Vail Resorts was $223.4 million or $5.47 per diluted share for the second quarter of fiscal 2022, compared to net income attributable to Vail Resorts of $147.8 million or $3.62 per diluted share in the previous year.\nResort reported EBITDA was $397.9 million in the second fiscal quarter, compared to resort reported EBITDA of $276.1 million in the same period the previous year.\nThe increase was primarily due to the greater impact of COVID-19 and related limitations and restrictions on results in the prior year.\nResort reported EBITDA for the second quarter of fiscal year 2020 was $378.3 million.\nWe will now examine our season-to-date metrics for the period from the start of the ski season through Sunday, March 6, 2022, compared to each of the two prior-year periods through March 7, 2021, and March 8, 2020.\nGiven the significant impacts of COVID-19 in the prior-year period, including substantial capacity restrictions that limited skier visits and ancillary revenue, we are also providing metrics relative to the comparable fiscal year 2020 season-to-date period, which was before our announcement to close our resorts on March 15, 2020, for the remainder of the 2019/2020 season.\nThe reported ski season metrics are for our North American destination mountain resorts and regional ski areas and exclude the results of our recently acquired Seven Springs resorts and our Australian ski areas in all periods.\nThe reported ski season metrics include growth for season pass revenue based on estimated fiscal year 2022 North American season pass revenue compared to both fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 North American season pass revenue.\nThe data mentioned in this release is interim period data and is subject to fiscal quarter-end review and adjustments.\nWe are pleased with the positive momentum we have observed throughout the post-Christmas period.\nSeason-to-date total skier visits increased by 2.8% compared to the fiscal year 2020 season-to-date period.\nSeason-to-date total lift ticket revenue, including an allocated portion of season pass revenue for each applicable period, increased by 10.3% compared to the fiscal year 2020 season-to-date period.\nCompared to the fiscal year 2020 season-to-date period, season-to-date ski school revenue decreased by 8.9%, dining revenue decreased by 27%, and retail rental for North American resort and ski area store locations decreased by 2.8%.\nThe company's performance has continued to show improvement after the Christmas season, particularly in terms of visitor numbers and ski pass sales.\nDespite a significant increase in pass program participation this year, visitor numbers for the season to date were only slightly higher at 2.8% compared to fiscal 2020, due to the company's strategy of encouraging lift ticket buyers to purchase advance commitment pass products.\nCOVID-19-related travel restrictions negatively affected Whistler Blackcomb, resulting in challenging conditions for U.S. and international visitors to the resort.\nAuxiliary business lines continued to see revenue decreases, especially in food and beverage, which was disproportionately affected by various operational constraints related to staffing and COVID-19.\nIt's noteworthy that our 47% growth in season pass units for fiscal year 2022 provided significant revenue stability during a period with difficult early season conditions and COVID-19 impacts.\nThe increase in pass units did not lead to substantial increases in visitation as the company is encouraging lift ticket buyers to switch to advance commitment products.\nIn fact, the visitation growth we observed in the period ending March 6, 2022, compared to fiscal 2020 occurred on weekdays and non-holiday periods, which saw a 9% increase in visits, while weekend and holiday periods remained relatively unchanged.\nWe also noticed that peak daily visitation at our resorts during this period was very similar to previous years.\nFor the season-to-date period ending March 6, 2022, season pass holders accounted for 69% of our visits, compared to 56% of visits for the same period in fiscal year 2020.\nWe remain dedicated to our strategy of encouraging lift ticket buyers to switch to advance commitment products, which benefits our guests and provides stability for our employees, communities, and company.\nNow let's discuss our outlook for fiscal 2022.\nDespite a challenging start to the season through the holidays, we have raised the midpoint of our Resort reported EBITDA guidance compared to our initial guidance in September, demonstrating the resilience of our business model and the advantages of our advance commitment strategy.\nThe guidance update is primarily due to strong demand from destination guests at our Western U.S. resorts, particularly in lift ticket sales, which we expect to continue for the rest of the season, as well as the contribution from the Seven Springs resorts.\nAdditionally, our lodging business is expected to significantly outperform our initial expectations for the remainder of the year, with strong results in both occupancy and ADR across our properties and the addition of the Seven Springs Resorts.\nDestination and international visitation trends at Whistler Blackcomb, the $20 million investment in frontline staff bonuses, increased wages for our summer operations, and the inclusion of an estimated $6 million in acquisition and integration-related expenses specific to the Seven Springs resorts.\nWe now anticipate net income attributable to Vail Resorts for fiscal 2022 to be between $304 million and $350 million, and resort reported EBITDA to be between $813 million and $837 million.\nWe estimate resort EBITDA margin for fiscal 2022 to be approximately 32.9% using the midpoint of the guidance range.\nThe updated outlook for fiscal year 2022 assumes normal conditions and operations across our resorts for the remainder of the ski season and no additional travel or operating restrictions associated with COVID-19 that could negatively impact our results, including for our Australian resorts in the fourth quarter.\nThe guidance assumes an exchange rate of $0.79 between the Canadian dollar and U.S. dollar related to the operations of Whistler Blackcomb in Canada and an exchange rate of $0.72 between the Australian dollar and U.S. dollar related to the operations of Perisher, Falls Creek, and Hotham in Australia.\nOur financial position remains robust.\nAs of January 31, 2022, our total cash and revolver availability was approximately $2 billion, with $1.4 billion in cash on hand, $417 million of U.S. revolver availability under the Vail Holdings credit agreement, and $214 million of revolver availability under the Whistler Credit Agreement.\nAs of January 31, 2022, our net debt was 2.1 times trailing 12 months total reported EBITDA.\nWe are happy to announce that our board of directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend on Vail Resorts common stock of $1.91 per share.\nThe dividend will be paid on April 14, 2022, to shareholders of record as of March 30, 2022.\nWe will continue to be prudent managers of our capital and remain committed to prioritizing investments in our guest and employee experience, high-return capacity expanding capital projects, strategic acquisition opportunities, and returning capital to our shareholders through our quarterly dividend and share repurchase programs.\nAs we look ahead to the 2022/2023 ski season and beyond, the company will be making its largest ever investment in both its employees and its resorts to ensure we continue to deliver our company mission of providing an experience of a lifetime.\nThe experience of our employees and our guests is fundamental to our business model, and the company intends to use its financial resources and stability it has created through its season pass program to continue to aggressively reinvest to deliver that experience.\nWe believe our business model allows us to make these investments and achieve our short- and long-term financial growth objectives.\nOur employees are central to Vail Resorts' mission of creating an experience of a lifetime.\nWe are pleased to announce a significant investment in our employees for the 2022/2023 North American ski season with an increase in the minimum hourly wage offered across all 37 of our North American resorts to USD 20 per hour for all U.S. employees and CAD 20 per hour for all Canadian employees, as well as an increase in wage rates for hourly employees, as we maintain all leadership and career stage differentials.\nPositions that require specific experiences or certifications, such as entry-level patrol, commercial drivers, and maintenance technicians, will start at $21 per hour.\nTipped employees will be guaranteed a minimum of $20 per hour.\nThe company will also be considering targeted increases beyond inflation for our salaried employees.\nWe will also be making a significant investment in our human resources department to ensure the right level of employee support, development, and recruiting.\nOur personnel are our most valuable resource and top priority across all company levels.\nWe anticipate these investments will significantly improve our employees' experience through better recruitment, retention, and professional development.\nOur workforce investments aim to achieve standard staffing levels, deliver exceptional customer service, support our advanced commitment strategy, provide greater business stability, and drive long-term growth.\nThe wage increase and return to normal staffing will result in an approximately $175 million rise in expected labor costs for fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022, including inflation adjustments.\nWe maintain our commitment to providing an outstanding guest experience and will continue to invest in enhancing our resort offerings.\nWe are dedicated to expanding capacity through lift, terrain, and food and beverage projects, and are making a significant one-time investment this year to accelerate this strategy.\nAs previously disclosed, we are moving forward with our ambitious $315 million to $325 million capital investment plan for calendar year 2022 across our resorts, excluding one-time integration activities, employee housing projects, and real estate developments.\nThe plan includes $180 million for installing 21 new or replacement lifts across 14 resorts and a major lift-served terrain expansion at Keystone.\nIn addition to two new lift configurations at Vail and Keystone, the replacement lifts will increase capacity at those locations by over 45%.\nAll projects are subject to regulatory approvals and are expected to be completed for the 2022/2023 North American winter season.\nThe core capital plan is about $150 million above our typical annual budget, accounting for inflation and recent acquisitions, including $20 million to complete one-time plans for Peak Resorts and Triple Peak acquisitions, and $3 million for annual capital expenditures associated with the Seven Springs Resorts.\nWe remain focused on developing and leveraging our data-driven approach to marketing and business operations.\nOur planned investments include network-wide scalable technology to enhance analytics, e-commerce, and guest engagement tools, improving our ability to target guests, personalize messages, and increase conversion rates.\nWe will invest in broader self-service capabilities to enhance guests' online experience and engagement.\nWe have announced a $4 million investment plan for Vail Resorts' Commitment to Zero initiative, including investments in high-efficiency snowmaking, heating and cooling infrastructure, and lighting to improve energy efficiency and progress toward our 2030 goal.\nWe plan to spend about $9 million on integration activities related to the recently acquired Seven Springs Resorts, including one-time investments and $3 million for real estate-related projects.\nOur total capital plan is expected to be approximately $327 million to $337 million.\nIncluding our 2022 capital plan, Vail Resorts will have invested over $2 billion in capital improvements since launching the Epic Pass, increasing capacity, enhancing guest experiences, and creating an integrated resort network.\nAs we plan for fiscal 2023, several COVID-19 and unusual weather-related factors negatively impacting fiscal 2022 need to be highlighted.\nTravel trends at Whistler Blackcomb, our Australian resorts, and our group business were significantly affected by COVID-19 in fiscal 2022.\nEarly season results across our resorts were hampered by challenging snow conditions.\nReturning to normal levels would result in an estimated $100 million increase in resort reported EBITDA for fiscal 2022.\nThe Seven Springs Resorts did not have a full year of operating results and were affected by acquisition and integration expenses.\nFull-year results without acquisition or integration expenses would yield an estimated $7 million increase in resort reported EBITDA for fiscal 2022.\nOur ancillary businesses were constrained by staffing issues and COVID-19 related operational restrictions in fiscal 2022.\nNormalizing our ancillary business would result in an estimated $75 million increase in resort reported EBITDA for fiscal 2022, including revenue and operating expenses associated with normal capacity, but excluding incremental labor costs.\nThe normalized labor expense for ancillary businesses is included in the $175 million labor investment.\nThese estimates assume normal conditions throughout ski seasons, continued strong consumer demand, consistent economic dynamics, and no significant ongoing COVID-19 impacts.\nThe estimated $182 million favorable resort reported EBITDA impact from business normalization is offset by the $175 million labor increase expected for fiscal 2023 to address staffing shortages and current labor market dynamics in resort communities.\nThese estimates do not account for fiscal 2023 projections for volume, price, or expense growth, which will be evaluated and incorporated into our full-year 2023 guidance planned for September 2022.\nWe are fully committed to providing an exceptional experience for our employees and guests.\nOur team is central to Vail Resorts' mission.\nI am profoundly grateful for their daily commitment and excited about the future as we make these important investments in our team and guest experience.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Aaron Ravenscroft, president and CEO, and Dave Antoniuk, executive VP and CFO, are joining the conference call\nProjections may not accurately reflect future outcomes due to various factors outlined in the company's most recent SEC documents\nThe year 2020 presented significant difficulties\nWhen the COVID-19 crisis began, we focused on three main goals: ensuring staff safety, maintaining financial stability, and preparing for long-term expansion\nI'm impressed with our team's handling of these unprecedented circumstances and their success in achieving our three main objectives\nLet's begin with safety considerations\nWe continue to experience a low number of COVID cases across our facilities\nMoreover, we achieved the lowest workplace injury rate in our company's history\nThe injury rate was recorded at 1.34\nNext, we concluded the year with a robust financial position\nWe have $120 million in cash and over $400 million in available funds\nLastly, we reinforced our foundation for future expansion\nDespite the pandemic, we continued to develop future leaders within our organization\nThroughout the year, about 200 frontline supervisors completed a year-long leadership program covering safety, leadership skills, and LEAN principles\nWe also initiated a mentoring program for our key female leaders, which has already led to several promotions\nOur LEAN journey progressed in 2020, with nearly 900 entries in our global Manitowoc Way Lessons Learned Competition\nWhile there were many worthy submissions, our Wilhelmshaven, Germany facility claimed the top prize\nThe team is currently working on a multi-year project to enhance production flow on the campus\nIn 2020, the team created a robotic measuring device that significantly improved our boom assembly process and paved the way for advancements in other aspects of this initiative\nAdditionally, this year we introduced the Manitowoc Way CEO Award to recognize a team member who exemplified both LEAN thinking and action\nI'd like to acknowledge Saleem Ahmed, test field supervisor in Wilhelmshaven\nSaleem independently engineered a system to convert manual boom cable drum alignment on the test field to an electronic process during assembly\nThis type of initiative embodies the values and culture of the Manitowoc Way business system\nMoving on to the financial results\nOur fourth quarter performance surpassed our expectations\nUpon closer examination, it's a story with two distinct aspects\nOur fourth quarter profitability significantly exceeded our forecast, primarily due to a favorable product mix\nWe experienced higher-than-anticipated book and ship demand for our tower cranes in Europe\nThis also resulted in improved factory absorption at the related sites\nHowever, while our orders and backlog surpassed our forecast, they were heavily influenced by a few large crawler orders and favorable exchange rates\nRegarding our balance sheet, we achieved our second-half goal of reducing inventory by $80 million on a currency-neutral basis\nI'll hand it over to Dave to provide more details on the financial results, after which I'll wrap up with some remarks on our outlook.\nLet's proceed to Slide 4.\nOur fourth-quarter orders reached $509 million, growing 8% compared to last year's $472 million.\nAdjusting for currency fluctuations, Q4 orders increased by $22 million or 5%.\nAs Aaron mentioned earlier, the order increase was mainly due to a few large crawler orders in the United States.\nOur year-end backlog for 2020 stood at $543 million, up 14% from the previous year and 10% when adjusted for currency effects.\nThe backlog growth was primarily attributed to increased crawler crane orders and Q4 shipment timing.\nFourth-quarter net sales of $430 million met our expectations but decreased by $33 million or 7% compared to the previous year.\nA decline in the Americas segment was partially counterbalanced by stronger performance in the EURAF and MEAP segments.\nNet sales benefited by about 4% from foreign currency exchange rate changes.\nOur fourth-quarter adjusted EBITDA was $34 million, an 11% increase year-over-year.\nWe surpassed last year's results and our quarterly projections due to a favorable product mix and reduced discretionary spending.\nAs a percentage of sales, the adjusted EBITDA margin improved to 7.9%, a 120 basis point increase from the previous year.\nWe incurred about $1 million in restructuring expenses during the fourth quarter, mainly related to severance costs in India and Europe.\nOur GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.05.\nOn an adjusted basis, diluted earnings per share decreased by $0.16 from the previous year to $0.19 per diluted share.\nThe year-over-year decline in adjusted diluted earnings per share was primarily due to higher income tax expenses resulting from our jurisdictional mix and the impact of net foreign currency losses, partially offset by improved operating income.\nWe generated $36 million in cash from operating activities during the quarter.\nWe achieved our currency-neutral inventory reduction target of $80 million in the second half of the year.\nMost of this improvement occurred in Q4, which was the primary source of our cash flow generation for the quarter.\nYear-over-year, our cash flow from operating activities decreased due to the timing of accounts receivable collections.\nWe finished the year with a cash balance of $129 million, a $70 million decrease from the previous year.\nNevertheless, our total liquidity remained strong at $412 million with no outstanding borrowings on our ABL.\nNow I'll summarize the financial results for the entire year.\nOrders totaled approximately $1.5 billion, a decrease of $127 million or 8% from the previous year.\nForeign currency exchange rates positively impacted 2020 orders by about 1%.\nLower orders in the Americas and EURAF segments were partially offset by gains in the MEAP segment.\nOur net sales for the year amounted to roughly $1.4 billion, a 21% decrease from 2019, and were positively affected by $12 million or 1% due to favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nThe year-over-year decrease was mainly due to starting the year with a lower shippable backlog, combined with reduced demand related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOur adjusted EBITDA fell by $74 million or 47% from the previous year, resulting in a 19% decremental margin on nearly $400 million less revenue.\nThis better-than-expected result demonstrates the dedication of our team members worldwide during these unprecedented times.\nWe successfully reduced our optional expenses while maintaining investment in new product development and expansion plans.\nThe team deserves recognition for their excellent performance.\nOur adjusted net loss for the entire year of 2020 was $12 million, in contrast to a net income of $67 million in 2019.\nThe adjusted diluted net loss per share of $0.35 was affected by roughly $0.01 due to our stock buybacks in the first quarter.\nAs stated before, we halted our share repurchase program in Q1 and don't plan to buy back more shares in 2021.\nThe full-year cash flows from operating activities showed a deficit of $35 million, mainly due to the timing of accounts receivable collections and the net loss recorded during the year.\nAs I mentioned earlier, we concluded the year with sufficient liquidity and a robust balance sheet.\nLet's proceed to Slide 5.\nLooking ahead to 2021, I view it as a transitional year, with progress and setbacks.\nAlthough we believe we've moved past the economic low point caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we anticipate an uneven recovery.\nThe recently implemented stimulus measures by various countries and the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines are positive developments.\nNevertheless, there's still a considerable way to go before returning to normalcy.\nUnfortunately, some of these actions will have unexpected consequences.\nMost importantly, while economic stimulus packages are crucial for recovery, government spending tends to generate inflation, which we're already observing in steel prices.\nFurthermore, the substantial debt accumulated in the United States has led to a weaker dollar.\nGiven the rapid changes in both these factors, I'm worried we'll experience a market disruption, creating short-term cost challenges for us.\nAdditionally, Manitowoc benefited from significant cost-cutting measures in 2020 that won't be repeated in 2021.\nConsidering our discretionary spending limits, bonus program expenses, social claim benefits, and rising insurance costs, we'll likely face over $15 million in additional costs.\nMoreover, with the increase in crawler cranes, our product mix is shifting towards lower-margin items, and we continue to struggle with low production levels at our German facility, where we manufacture all-terrain cranes.\nPlease move to Slide 6.\nWe're continuing to invest in our future growth.\nWe've allocated $15 million in capital expenditure to further expand our European tower crane rental fleet in 2021.\nWe're growing our Chinese tower crane business that serves the Belt and Road regions.\nWe're accelerating our product development programs for our all-terrain product line, which we'll showcase at Bauma in 2022.\nWe're also actively pursuing acquisitions.\nThese growth initiatives require more investment than we've made in recent years, but we're confident these strategic moves will drive our future growth as the crane industry recovers.\nTo conclude, the current economic climate is highly dynamic in terms of demand and costs.\nTherefore, we won't provide specific financial guidance for 2021.\nGenerally speaking, we expect our revenue to increase slightly, but there are clear indications that we'll face margin pressure due to cost increases and product mix changes while investing in future growth.\n2021 will be a year of transition.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Today I'm accompanied by Steve Westhoven, our CEO and President, Pat Migliaccio, our CFO, and other senior executives.\nAs noted on the first slide, actual outcomes may significantly deviate from our projections.\nWe'll be discussing certain non-GAAP metrics like net financial earnings (NFE).\nWe consider NFE to offer a more comprehensive view of our financial performance.\nNevertheless, it shouldn't be seen as a replacement for GAAP.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures are elaborated on in Item 7 of our 10-K.\nThe meeting's schedule is outlined on slide two.\nSteve will kick off the call with quarterly highlights, after which Pat will go over our financial results.\nNew Jersey Resources showed robust performance in Q1.\nI'll walk you through the key points on slide three.\nWe posted NFE of $0.46 per share, primarily due to the strong showing of our main business, New Jersey Natural Gas.\nWe're maintaining our fiscal 2021 NFE guidance of $1.55 to $1.65 per share and raising our fiscal 2022 NFE projection to $2.20 to $2.30 per share, a $0.15 increase from previous estimates.\nAt New Jersey Natural Gas, we've finished nearly 90% of the Southern Reliability Link and plan to operationalize it this year.\nWe received the green light for our Infrastructure Investment Program, a $150 million accelerated recovery initiative spanning 5 years to enhance our natural gas infrastructure's resilience and reliability.\nWe've also submitted SAVEGREEN 2020, a new energy efficiency initiative aimed at helping customers reduce energy use and costs.\nIn our Clean Energy Ventures division, we purchased the 2.9 megawatt Mt. Laurel Solar Facility, part of our $165 million investment plan for this year.\nIn our Storage & Transportation segment, we've begun transforming the southern part of Adelphia Gateway to natural gas and expect it to be operational later this year.\nJust yesterday, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear PennEast's appeal.\nDespite this positive development, we're still excluding PennEast from our long-term forecasts until we have more clarity on the project.\nAt NJR Energy Services, we entered into asset management agreements that will yield contracted cash proceeds of $501 million over a decade.\nI'll provide more details about this transaction on the next slide.\nMoving to slide four.\nEnergy Services entered into several AMAs with a public utility of investment-grade status.\nThese deals showcase the value of our natural gas storage and transportation contract portfolio and reflect our talented team's hard work.\nThe transactions help our counterparty secure needed supply while allowing Energy Services to monetize part of its controlled assets.\nLet me break down the specifics.\nStarting November 2021, our fiscal year 2022, NJRES will begin releasing portions of our pipeline capacity.\nUnder the agreement terms, NJRES will receive $261 million in payments over the AMAs' first three years.\nPost FY 2024, NJRES will get additional yearly payments of about $34 million through 2031.\nNJRES benefits include extracting asset value without relying on weather-related price volatility and reducing operational risks tied to directly managing these transportation assets.\nThis will lead to more predictable earnings and cash flows and a lower-risk Energy Services business.\nThese transactions also allow us to raise our fiscal 2022 guidance by $0.15 per share, as shown on the next slide.\nLater, Pat will explain other financial impacts of these transactions.\nTurning to our fiscal 2022 NFE guidance on slide five, we're increasing our overall projection to $2.20 to $2.30 per share.\nThis demonstrates the influence of the AMAs and the anticipated cash settlement of our equity forward.\nNevertheless, our long-term yearly growth rate of 6% to 10% remains anchored to our initially communicated guidance of $2.05 to $2.15 per share, which does not include the effect of the AMAs or any other contribution from Energy Services.\nAs Pat will explain later, the NFE advantages of AMAs will vary from year to year.\nOn slide six, I'll guide you through some of the operational achievements.\nExamining the upper left, we invested $89 million in New Jersey Natural Gas during the first quarter, with approximately one-third of the capital expenditure yielding near-immediate returns.\nIn spite of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we gained over 1,900 new customers, only marginally below the customer additions from the same period last year, which was before the pandemic.\nThis can be attributed to the favorable growth demographics in our service areas.\nWork on the Southern Reliability Link is advancing, and we have now completed almost 90% of the project, with an expected in-service date this year.\nWe intend to submit our rate case to recover the expenses associated with the project in fiscal 2021.\nAs I mentioned earlier, we received approval for our IIP program and submitted SAVEGREEN 2020.\nOn slide seven, I'll guide you through the operational highlights of our other core business, Clean Energy Ventures.\nWe increased our capacity by 2.9 megawatts this quarter.\nAs you can see in the top right, we now have a total installed capacity of 360 megawatts.\nWe have a robust project pipeline with approximately $260 million worth of investments, either under contract or exclusivity, that are targeted for commercial operation in fiscal 2021 and 2022.\nTotal invested capital at CEV this quarter was $23 million, with $17 million in commercial projects and $6 million in Sunlight Advantage.\nThe bottom right displays our projected CEV revenue for fiscal 2021, a significant portion of which is secured through our SREC hedging program.\nThe sustainability agenda we've outlined for our company centers on innovation, emissions reductions, energy efficiency, and transparency.\nI'm pleased to report that NJR has made substantial progress.\nIn the previous quarter, we announced that NJR achieved our goal of reducing our New Jersey operational emissions by 50% of 2006 levels, well ahead of schedule.\nWe have now set a new, more ambitious target of 60% reduction by 2030.\nThis is a significant achievement that reflects decades of investment in safety and environmental responsibility.\nIt demonstrates our strong commitment to sustainability and the hard work of our team.\nOur new target ensures our company's goals align with the state's 2050 statutory goals for emissions reduction.\nLast month, we released our 12th Annual Corporate Sustainability Report, which is accessible on our website.\nFor the first time, this year's report includes ESG reporting and disclosures established by SASB, which is another step towards increasing transparency and strengthening our communications with our investors in the financial communities on these issues.\nSlide 10 illustrates the main factors influencing our NFE for the first quarter.\nAs we communicated at our Analyst Day in November, this is the first quarter where we're employing the deferral method of accounting for CEV.\nConsequently, we've recalculated our financials for the comparable periods.\nReported NFE of $44.7 million or $0.46 per share compared to NFE of $34.9 million or $0.38 per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2020.\nNew Jersey Natural Gas experienced an NFE improvement of $5.6 million, primarily due to a full quarter of higher base rates from NJNG's fiscal 2020 rate case settlement compared to a partial quarter a year ago.\nCEV decreased by $2, mainly due to increased O&M expenses related to project maintenance costs, particularly with new projects placed in service, which was partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense.\nStorage & Transportation saw a modest increase during the quarter, mostly related to increased operating income from Leaf River, and was offset by interest expense related to the acquisitions of Leaf River and Adelphia Gateway.\nEnergy services improved by $6.6 million, primarily due to higher financial margin compared to last year, resulting from increased natural gas pricing spreads.\nHome Services and Other experienced slightly lower operating revenue and slightly higher interest expense.\nWe reconfirmed our NFE guidance of $1.55 to $1.65 per share for fiscal 2021, as Steve pointed out.\nSlide 11 displays the segment contributions, with our primary businesses, NJNG and CEV, making up 80% of total NFE.\nLet me explain how we anticipate NJNG's utility gross margin and CEV's revenues will be distributed to help you understand the quarterly breakdown of our net financial earnings.\nWe anticipate recognizing about 70% of NJNG's utility gross margin in the first half of the year, consistent with historical patterns.\nThe bulk of CEV's revenue will come in the latter half of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter when we expect to recognize most of our SREC revenue.\nWe anticipate that our Storage & Transportation business's net financial earnings contributions will remain relatively steady throughout the year due to fixed-price contracts.\nThe specifics of our SREC hedging program are outlined on slide 12.\nWe continue to actively hedge to protect SREC revenues from future price fluctuations.\nWe've increased our hedge level to 75% for energy year 2023.\nFor energy year 2024, market fundamentals and pricing remain robust, with SREC trading at over 85% of SACP, and we've now hedged 49% of our 2024 volumes.\nMoving to slide 13, I'll clarify some of the intricacies involved in achieving revenue recognition for the AMAs.\nAccording to the agreements, NJR will initially release the transportation capacity to our counterparty before permanently releasing the contracts to the utility.\nThe accounting standard requires allocating revenue to both the initial and permanent releases, with a disproportionate amount assigned to the permanent releases occurring in fiscal years 2024 and 2032.\nThis allocation will result in a discrepancy between revenue and cash proceeds.\nIt's worth noting that while revenue provides a general indication of NFE, it doesn't account for taxes, demand charges, and other factors.\nImportantly, the cash proceeds offer additional benefits that I'll elaborate on shortly.\nAs shown on slide 14, we now project our cash flows from operations to grow at a CAGR of approximately 25% from fiscal 2020 to 2024, up from our previous estimate of 20%.\nThe chart on the right demonstrates that the strength of our cash flows suggests our dividends are expected to become a smaller percentage, supporting our long-term dividend growth rate of 6% to 10%.\nSlide 15 illustrates another benefit of the AMAs: improved credit metrics.\nAs reported at our Analyst Day, our FFO to adjusted debt ratio is increasing from fiscal 2022 to 2024.\nWith the positive impact of the AMAs, our metrics are expected to rise to the high teens in fiscal 2022 and reach about 20% by fiscal 2024.\nDue to these strong credit metrics, we will cash settle the equity forward established during our December 2019 equity issuance.\nAt that time, we issued 5.3 million shares and entered into an equity forward to issue an additional 1.2 million shares later, which is no longer necessary.\nAs mentioned during our Analyst Day, we don't foresee any block equity needs in the near future.\nBefore taking questions, I'd like to summarize the quarter.\nNJR has started fiscal 2021 well and is on track to meet our NFEPS guidance for this fiscal year.\nWe've raised our fiscal 2022 NFEPS guidance by $0.15 per share and expect strong cash flow to support our dividend growth.\nOur key infrastructure projects, SRL and Adelphia Gateway, are progressing and are expected to be in service this calendar year.\nOur improved credit metrics allow us to cash settle our equity forward.\nAs stated at our Investor Day, we don't need further block equity issuances.\nWe've made significant progress in our commitment to reduce risk in the Energy Services business by providing more stable fee-based revenue.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:They entail hazards and unpredictability, and actual outcomes may vary significantly.\nOur remarks also incorporate non-GAAP financial metrics.\nFor Q1 2021, NOV reported $1.25 billion in revenue and a $115 million net loss using U.S. GAAP standards.\nWe will have a Q&A session later in the call.\nThe oil industry faced a double blow in 2020: an oil price war followed by a pandemic-induced collapse in demand, leading to a steep decline in oilfield equipment and consumables sales throughout the year.\nNOV's Q1 2021 results reflect the full impact of these events, which caused an exceptionally severe downturn in an industry known for harsh slumps.\nAs mentioned in our March 16 update, the quarter was further affected by severe winter weather and power outages in Texas and Oklahoma, causing 63 NOV facilities to close for a week or more.\nNew pandemic restrictions overseas also shut down several large plants and disrupted supply chains for certain raw materials, particularly fiberglass and resin.\nThe quarter was also impacted by higher costs on two projects due to poor execution on our part.\nA new pipe design proved more expensive to manufacture than anticipated.\nAn offshore platform component was delayed due to engineering taking longer than expected.\nBoth issues have been resolved.\nDespite these challenges, our final quarterly results slightly exceeded our March forecast due to better progress on cost reductions and increasing signs of recovery in the oil industry, particularly in Wellbore Technologies and North America.\nWhile we still face challenges in many markets, we are increasingly confident that the worst is behind us.\nNorth American oilfield activity continued to recover during the quarter, with March revenues significantly higher than January for certain early-cycle domestic businesses, while international results showed early signs of recovery as well.\nHowever, the first quarter's sequential decline in capital equipment revenues reflects the severe impact on our backlog in 2020, leading to a 6% drop in consolidated revenue.\nEBITDA fell to breakeven, which is unacceptable and is prompting further cost-cutting measures.\nAs a supplier of capital equipment and spare parts to the oilfield, our results typically lag behind those of our customers.\nQ1 2021 reflects the previous nine months of plummeting oil demand and virtually no capital spending, offset by substantial downsizing and cost reductions.\nWe believe this downturn is the most severe our industry has ever experienced.\nOil prices turned negative in April.\nThe U.S. rig count hit its lowest level since World War II in August.\nNorth American frac fleet utilization dropped to single digits.\nBy year-end, over 100 North American oil and gas companies had filed for bankruptcy protection with a combined debt exceeding $100 billion.\nIf not for a few large projects awarded before the lockdown, offshore project FIDs in 2020 would have been the lowest since 1960.\nAlthough recovery has begun in many markets, average first quarter rig counts were down 46% for North America land, 36% for international land, and 31% for offshore year-over-year.\nWhen I say it has been a historically bad downturn, I mean it has been a measurably and provably historically bad downturn.\nIn this environment, our oilfield service customers are following the tried-and-true survival strategy of cannibalizing equipment, spares, and consumables, postponing maintenance, reducing spending to bare minimum levels, and conserving cash.\nNOV's biggest competitor in this environment is idle equipment.\nBy autumn, every stacked rig had become an additional source of drill pipe, shaker screens, handling tools, etc., and this dynamic applies across all categories of oilfield equipment when utilization collapses and service companies struggle to stay afloat.\nA year ago, day rates began rapidly declining to find a bottom at daily cash costs, which were insufficient to cover long-term maintenance expenses, let alone capital consumption costs represented by depreciation.\nFor many sectors, year-end 2020 day rates reflected desperation, with companies discounting to keep some assets and crews working and spending cash only as a last resort.\nAs a result, NOV's oilfield backlogs declined throughout the year, and the first quarter annualized revenue run rate is down 45% from just five quarters ago.\nHere's the positive news: 160 years of oilfield history shows that this situation is always temporary.\nThe amount of idle equipment available for cannibalization decreases as activity resumes, and dwindling spares and consumables must be replenished as utilization improves.\nWe're starting to see early signs of this in certain areas as rigs and frac fleets return to work.\nIdle, stripped drilling rigs must have cannibalized pumps and handling tools replaced to resume service.\nThis rebuilding, restocking, and reactivation phenomenon occurs when service company desperation is fading and optimism is growing with increasing oilfield activity.\nWe know this because NOV has experienced similar recovery cycles in the past.\nAs the oilfield becomes busier, customers will soon start to worry about the significant cash investment required to reactivate rigs and equipment.\nConsider the courage needed to invest your precious cash in a business that almost bankrupted you last year.\nThat's the challenge our customers face when it comes to reactivations.\nWe believe our customers will demand higher pricing on their additional assets returning to work to mitigate risk by achieving quicker paybacks on their reactivation investments.\nThey'll also need to cover rising wage pressures and other inflationary forces, which I'll discuss shortly.\nIf oil prices remain favorable, pricing momentum will significantly boost margins and returns, as is typical in the cyclical business we serve.\nNOV will be a key beneficiary of this unit reactivation investment.\nAs various basins and equipment categories pass through the inflection point to emerge into higher day rate regimes, their orders for capital equipment will accelerate.\nThis is the sweet spot of our business model.\nThe historic oilfield events of 2020 have predictably led to a massive dismantling of well construction capability by the oilfield services industry, following the tried-and-true playbook I mentioned earlier.\nEvery surviving oilfield service company has made it this far by downsizing exceptionally well.\nCollectively, our surviving customers are the dream team of cost-cutters.\nThey've been working hard at it for several years, intensifying their cost-cutting efforts threefold in 2020.\nIt's logical to conclude that the overall capacity to construct wells has been significantly reduced in our view.\nIf global economies continue to recover from COVID and demand more oil, the oilfield services industry will be challenged to return to normalized levels of wellbore construction sufficient to meet rising oil demand.\nWe think that's more likely than not.\nFirst, governments worldwide responded to the economic turmoil of the pandemic with unprecedented stimulus packages.\nFor example, the G10 plus China passed more than $20 trillion in stimulus in total.\nThis has led to remarkable money supply growth.\nThe U.S. M2 is up 27% year-over-year, for instance.\nGenerally, money supply growth and low interest rates inflate asset prices, including commodity prices like oil.\nNext, pharmaceutical companies developed vaccines, several in fact.\nWhile there are ups and downs, global vaccination efforts are progressing, positioning the world to emerge from the pandemic lockdown.\nMassive economic stimulus and a powerful catalyst, vaccines, to more or less simultaneously reopen economies, combined with significantly improved household balance sheets and a widespread desire to return to normalcy, well, I can't imagine a more compelling recipe for a synchronized global economic recovery of a magnitude we haven't seen since the 1950s post-war boom.\nWe believe this synchronized recovery will lead to increased oil consumption.\nIn fact, leading indicators for crude oil, gasoline, and distillate demand already suggest a stronger recovery than many economists anticipated, and global inventory levels appear to be normalizing ahead of schedule.\nOverall, this creates a highly favorable backdrop for oil prices in the coming years, in our opinion.\nKey risks to this outlook include excess Saudi and OPEC capacity, which is scheduled to gradually increase over the next few months, and the potential return of Iranian crude production.\nHowever, the record levels of crude inventories achieved in the first half of 2020 have, as far as we can tell, largely dissipated.\nThis only happens because withdrawals have exceeded additions.\nSo supply, artificially kept low by OPEC, has been less than demand, artificially suppressed by the pandemic lockdown.\nThe crucial question is what the picture will look like as artificial constraints on both ease.\nAnother potential concern is the exceptional growth rates achieved by U.S. shale production at various points over the last ten years.\nTechnological advancements like simultaneous fracturing indicate the domestic exploration and production industry's continuous push for greater efficiency.\nHowever, it's worth noting that the domestic E&P sector previously benefited from abundant cheap capital to fund growth-focused drilling programs, as well as financial pressure on oilfield services that kept pricing below sustainable levels.\nFunding, when available, is now significantly more expensive.\nThis trend seems to be intensifying as environmental, social, and governance factors become more influential in investment decisions.\nAdditionally, the investments needed to rebuild oilfield service capabilities for well construction will require higher returns.\nConsider also the consolidation among domestic E&P companies, the increased cost of attracting workers back to the oilfield during a major economic expansion offering numerous high-paying alternatives, and it becomes clear that achieving substantial production growth from U.S. shales will be more difficult this time.\nBeyond the artificial production limits imposed by OPEC, Russia and Saudi Arabia, and the artificial consumption restrictions due to COVID-related economic lockdowns, there is significant depletion occurring.\nAll oil wells experience declining production over time.\nThe extent to which these artificial constraints have masked the overall natural decline of oil wells is unclear.\nWhile we can debate the true supply and demand situation, we can all agree that both are far less transparent in 2021 than in any previous year.\nAfter all, we've never experienced an economic shutdown of this magnitude before.\nThe key point is this: when the industry significantly reduces exploration, development, and the ongoing construction of platforms, projects and wells that produce the oil our global economy depends on, and further dismantles the oilfield services industry that performs this work, there will be consequences.\nThroughout this unprecedented period, NOV has consistently focused on: reducing costs, which have decreased by $12.6 billion since 2014, including about $2 billion in annual fixed cost reductions; improving cash flow, which has reduced our debt; and investing in next-generation technologies for both the oilfield and emerging renewable opportunities.\nWhether it's advanced rig floor technology like our robotic pipe handling system controlled by our NOVOS digital environment, our ideal e-frac fleet equipped with QuickLatch and FlexConnect systems to reduce emissions and labor in the completion process, or NOV Max, our digital platform that integrates various data sources for operators, NOV remains at the forefront of next-generation oilfield technology.\nOur efforts in supporting the energy transition focus on areas where we believe we can establish significant competitive advantages while delivering superior economic returns for our customers in wind, solar, geothermal and other emerging energy sources.\nSeven out of eight Wellbore Technologies business units saw sequential growth in the first quarter, indicating rising demand for certain products.\nAs a result, we began adding manufacturing shifts and achieved the highest level of absorption since the first quarter of 2020.\nNOV gained market share for our ReedHycalog bits in West Texas and Saudi Arabia, despite price increases, due to strong performance and increasing activity.\nDemand for drilling motors is also rising, and downhole friction reduction tools are completely sold out in some North American markets, with revenues up over 30% sequentially.\nWe increased drilling motor pricing by double digits in certain areas.\nNorth American rig instrumentation and solids control services pricing has increased by double digits for new work, returning to pre-COVID levels and poised for further increases.\nIn our international markets, we expect our wired drill pipe jobs to increase by over 25% in the second quarter.\nOperators are increasingly recognizing the value of real-time, high-bandwidth data from the bottom of their drill strings, which is only available through our proprietary IntelliServ Wired Drill Pipe technology.\nGlobal OCTG demand appears to be increasing, leading to double-digit sequential growth in NOV Tuboscope's pipe inspection services worldwide.\nDespite ongoing day rate pressure on drilling contractors, Grant Prideco achieved a book-to-bill ratio greater than 100% as operators require larger 5.5-inch drill pipe for improved hydraulic performance, prompting drilling contractors to purchase this pipe with our proprietary Delta premium connections.\nOverall, higher oil prices and rig counts, particularly in North America, have positioned Wellbore Technologies at the forefront of the oilfield recovery.\nIn contrast, Completion & Production Solutions and Rig Technology segments continue to face challenges due to low capital equipment backlogs and cautious customer spending.\nHowever, the CAPS segment saw its book-to-bill ratio for new capital equipment orders exceed 100% for the first time since the fourth quarter of 2019, suggesting improved results ahead.\nThe group's North American quick-turn businesses began to see improvement.\nNorth American production chokes backlog increased by 30% and our reciprocating pump backlog grew 69% sequentially.\nWe secured another Tier 4 dual fuel fleet upgrade for a domestic pressure pumping service provider, and demand for coiled tubing strings tripled from its low point in the second quarter of last year.\nWhile we lost a large project in Alaska, we won another significant project for Brazil, both indicating that operators may be moving forward with decisions after prolonged COVID-related delays.\nRig Technology faces challenging conditions for rig capital expenditure in the near term, but saw double-digit growth in spare parts orders, following two consecutive quarters of record low spare parts orders.\nIt is also seeing increasing inquiries for rig engineering related to offshore drilling rig reactivations.\nSo while our first quarter results were poor, I'm becoming more confident that results will improve significantly as the year progresses.\nOur spare parts, consumables, and services businesses tied to activity are already seeing improvement, and our sales force is quickly adjusting pricing to acceptable levels.\nRecovery for our capital equipment businesses always begins with rising orders, which we started to see in many businesses for the first time in 1.5 years.\nYou have effectively positioned the company to support our customers and capitalize on opportunities to serve them better.\nMost importantly, throughout a challenging year, you've taken care of each other.\nI'm extremely proud to work with you and appreciate all your efforts.\nJose, Blake and I look forward to better times with you as conditions improve through 2021.\nNOV's consolidated revenue decreased by $78 million or 6% sequentially to $1.25 billion in the first quarter of 2021.\nThe sequential decline resulted from ongoing austerity from our customer base, operational disruptions from severe weather, and COVID-19 challenges, which continue to affect global supply chains.\nA simple summary of the quarter is that January was extremely slow, February was disrupted by freezing conditions, and in March, orders began to increase significantly, allowing us to recover much of the lost ground and giving us confidence that our results will improve throughout the rest of the year.\nOngoing cost reduction initiatives, a higher-margin revenue mix, and improved pricing limited sequential decremental margins to 22%.\nHowever, we are not satisfied with this performance, given that we are at breakeven EBITDA, which is unacceptable in any market environment.\nWe continue to challenge our organization to find new ways to increase efficiencies.\nDuring Q1, we realized $52 million in annualized cost savings and identified an additional $31 million in opportunities, bringing the total we expect to achieve in 2021 to $106 million.\nIn the first quarter, our operations used $27 million in cash and capital expenditures totaled $49 million.\nIt's typical for the organization to consume cash in the first quarter, and we expect to be free cash flow positive for the year.\nWe ended the first quarter with $1.61 billion in cash and $1.85 billion in gross debt, or net debt of $244 million.\nAfter the quarter ended, we fully redeemed the remaining $183 million of our senior notes due in December 2022 using cash on hand.\nAs a result, our next bond maturity is not until December 2029, and interest expense should decrease by approximately $1 million per quarter.\nRegarding our segment results, our Wellbore Technologies segment generated $413 million in revenue during the first quarter, an increase of $40 million or 11% sequentially.\nCost reductions, improved absorption in our manufacturing plants, a more favorable sales mix, and better pricing led to 55% incremental margins and a $22 million increase in EBITDA to $34 million or 8.2% of sales.\nOur ReedHycalog drill bit business achieved 20% revenue growth with strong improvements across the Western Hemisphere.\nReedHycalog's technology leadership is driving market share gains in most markets, and these gains helped drive modest revenue growth in the Eastern Hemisphere during a quarter that typically sees a seasonal slowdown.\nMarket share gains, improved absorption, better pricing, and cost-cutting resulted in incremental margins of almost 50%.\nWe expect our ReedHycalog business to post another solid sequential improvement in Q2, led by growing activity in the Middle East and Asia Pacific markets.\nOur Downhole Tool business realized a 13% sequential improvement in revenue, led by sales growth that significantly outpaced the increase in drilling activity in the Western Hemisphere, partially offset by seasonal declines in the Eastern Hemisphere.\nOperators working to reduce trips, maximize hydraulic flow, and reduce friction are driving improved demand for our SelectShift drilling motor, fluid hammer, impulse axial pulse technology, and agitator tools.\nA more favorable sales mix, higher volumes, improved operational efficiencies, and better pricing allowed the business to deliver 50% incremental margins during the quarter.\nOur WellSite Services business realized a 16% sequential increase in revenue, primarily from improving results in its solid control operations.\nThe business unit has steadily recaptured market share in North America from struggling competitors that have exited the market over the last several quarters and is now starting to improve pricing.\nOur M/D Totco business realized low single-digit revenue growth in the first quarter.\nRevenue from surface sensor and data acquisition offerings in the Western Hemisphere improved in line with drilling activity but was partially offset by the seasonal decrease in capital equipment sales to the Eastern Hemisphere.\nThe business unit's eVolve wire drill pipe optimization services achieved record rental service revenue, and as mentioned earlier, secured additional jobs for Q2.\nOur track record of improving drilling efficiencies for operators is driving an increasing rate of adoption.\nHowever, the relatively high cost of wire drill pipe in a capital-constrained market has mostly limited the service offering to operators with complex wells and tight drilling parameters.\nWe believe our new low-cost, next-generation wire drill pipe technology could significantly expand the market and accelerate the adoption of our wired drill pipe enabled services.\nOur Tuboscope division saw a 10% sequential rise in revenue for pipe coating and inspection services.\nInspection service demand improved worldwide, with particularly strong growth in the U.S. where steel mill and processor piece counts rose 43%.\nCoating operations revenue decreased due to seasonal declines in the Eastern Hemisphere outweighing increased North American demand.\nGrant Prideco drill pipe division achieved a high single-digit sequential revenue increase.\nA higher proportion of large-diameter premium pipe in sales led to strong margins despite winter storm-related costs, including repairs, overtime, and scrapping due to power outages during heat-treating.\nThe division achieved a 104% book-to-bill ratio, indicating potential further improvement in Q2.\nNorth American orders comprised 31% of total orders, the highest percentage in some time.\nStrong demand for 5.5-inch pipe was driven by operators seeking greater hydraulic efficiencies, aligning with demand for high flow rate drilling tools, while ample supplies of 4.5- and 5-inch customer-owned drill pipe remain in the U.S.\nFor Wellbore Technologies, we anticipate moderate activity gains in the U.S. and Latin America, with Eastern Hemisphere recovery leading to 8-10% sequential revenue growth in Q2.\nWe expect continued cost structure improvements and better pricing, potentially allowing for incremental EBITDA margins near 50%.\nCompletion & Production Solutions generated $439 million in Q1 revenue, a 20% sequential decrease of $107 million.\nThe decline was primarily due to depleted backlogs, severe weather disruptions, and supply chain challenges.\nCost reduction efforts and operational efficiency improvements limited decremental margins to 30%, with EBITDA declining $32 million to a $4 million loss.\nSegment orders improved $57 million sequentially to $338 million, resulting in a 127% book-to-bill ratio, the first over 100% since Q4 2019.\nWe began including subsurface fiberglass fuel storage tank orders in our capital equipment backlog; excluding this, the book-to-bill would have been 115%.\nFiber Glass Systems experienced a 25% sequential revenue decline.\nThe unit faced challenges typical of our capital equipment businesses in Q1, including absorption issues from five consecutive quarters with sub-1 book-to-bill ratios, severe COVID-19 and weather-related disruptions.\nCOVID outbreaks shut down two large Malaysian manufacturing facilities for three weeks, while pandemic-related supply chain issues caused shortages of epoxy resin and glass fiber, limiting production.\nSevere winter weather hampered operations and caused customer delivery deferrals due to transportation constraints and installation difficulties.\nDespite these challenges, the team maintained positive EBITDA margins.\nWhile supply challenges may persist until August, the business outlook is improving daily.\nA significant increase in March orders for fuel handling products resulted in a book-to-bill ratio above 100%.\nDemand is returning for marine scrubbers in Asia and fiberglass pipe in the Middle East, suggesting steady improvement throughout 2021.\nIntervention & Stimulation Equipment experienced a mid-single-digit sequential decline in Q1, its fifth consecutive quarter of declining revenue.\nDespite continued North American market weakness, the segment achieved its second straight quarter with a book-to-bill ratio above 1.\nWireline equipment demand, particularly in the Middle East, Europe, and Africa, has been a bright spot.\nGlobal coiled tubing business saw a sharp Q1 decline, but international market quoting activity remains healthy, and improving U.S. completions activity is driving greater consumables demand.\nPressure pumping activity has increased significantly, but customer service pricing remains well below pre-COVID levels, forcing equipment cannibalization and low-cost purchases of distressed equipment.\nCannibalization opportunities are limited, and equipment auction quality is deteriorating rapidly.\nWe're seeing a significant increase in quotes for new equipment, albeit from extremely low levels.\nQ1 cementing equipment orders doubled compared to the entire second half of 2020.\nDemand is increasing for stimulation equipment with enhanced capabilities and reduced emissions.\nWe booked an order to convert 16 Tier 2 frac pumps to Tier 4 DGB dual fuel units, capable of running on diesel and natural gas, lowering costs and emissions.\nInterest is growing in our ideal e-frac stimulation equipment, which recently completed its first field trial, completing over 200 stages at rates up to 22 barrels per minute.\nWith improved bookings and growing aftermarket service demand, we expect a meaningful Q2 revenue increase for Intervention & Stimulation Equipment.\nXL Systems conductor pipe business saw a sharp sequential revenue decline due to a depleted backlog after eight consecutive quarters with a sub-1 book-to-bill ratio.\nThe team limited decremental margins to 17% and achieved a 143% book-to-bill ratio, indicating improving market conditions.\nCustomer behavior has been mixed, with some awarding work then delaying deliveries, while others are urgently ordering for near-term spud dates.\nCompetition remains fierce, with some competitors offering unsustainable pricing and payment terms.\nOur technological and quality differentiation allows us to win projects not entirely driven by pricing, such as an award for the industry's first 20,000-psi well development project.\nSubsea flexible pipe business experienced a low double-digit sequential revenue decline with high decremental margins due to lower volumes, less favorable product mix, and manufacturing challenges with a new pipe design.\nWhile bookings remained light, customer dialogue and order outlook have improved, particularly in Brazil, where large projects are expected to advance later this year.\nExact timing remains uncertain due to extreme COVID-19-related challenges in Brazil, making coordination and essential engineering work difficult.\nWe believe offshore production-oriented components of our CAPS segment are at or near bottom.\nSome previously delayed offshore production-related projects are starting to move forward, and we're hopeful that stronger oil prices could support more FIDs throughout the year.\nFor Q2 2021, we anticipate Completion & Production Solutions segment revenue will improve 15-25% sequentially, with incremental margins in the mid-20% range.\nRig Technologies generated $431 million in Q1 revenue, a 1% sequential decrease of $6 million.\nA small increase in offshore wind-related capital equipment sales was offset by seasonal declines in aftermarket services.\nLess favorable revenue mix and weather-related disruptions led to a $6 million EBITDA decline to $13 million, or 3% of sales.\nSegment orders declined $78 million sequentially to $112 million, yielding a 59% book-to-bill ratio, the sixth out of seven quarters below 1.\nRig capital equipment orders remained weak as drilling contractors continued to cannibalize idle equipment and minimize spending.\nDespite improving activity and dialogue, customer urgency remains low.\nQuotation levels increased 25% sequentially, and quote-to-order conversion improved, but only for small orders.\nLarger orders are not being lost to competitors or canceled, but continue to be delayed.\nOngoing COVID-19 outbreaks in international markets and uncertainty around offshore drilling contractor bankruptcy exits are not inspiring confidence.\nMiddle Eastern and Asian customers express need for newbuild rigs, and offshore customers require meaningful upgrades for reactivations, but lack of urgency is expected to keep the book-to-bill ratio for traditional rig equipment below 1.\nWe're optimistic that a few more quarters of stable commodity prices and improving activity levels will help move projects forward.\nWe began manufacturing the first two rigs from our new Saudi Arabian plant, which has a commitment for 50 drilling rigs over 10 years and $1.8 billion in backlog.\nWe expect to deliver the first rig at the end of this year, one per quarter in 2022, and five per year from 2023.\nAftermarket spare part bookings increased 22%, led by Middle East and U.S. land markets as rig cannibalization opportunities diminish.\nSeveral large offshore customers are in late stages of restructuring, with significant equipment in our shops.\nWe're optimistic that once capital structures are reset and more FIDs advance, we'll see a meaningful increase in service, repair, and recertification work.\nOur renewables business contrasts sharply with the traditional rig business.\nWe booked an order for design, jacking systems, and crane for a European wind turbine installation vessel.\nQ1 offshore wind orders were modest compared to over $400 million in potential projects that could be awarded before year-end.\nFor Q2, we expect growth in renewables, improving aftermarket activity, and progress on Saudi Arabian rigs to offset weak rig capital equipment orders, leading to Rig Technology segment results in line with Q1.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Bill McDermott, our president and CEO, and Gina Mastantuono, our CFO, are accompanying me.\nWe will examine our Q3 2021 financial results and provide financial guidance for Q4 and full-year 2021 during this call.\nWe present non-GAAP measures alongside, not in place of, GAAP-calculated financial measures.\nOur website will feature a recording of today's call.\nAlthough ServiceNow's performance consistently exceeds expectations, it remains remarkable.\nOur team once again delivered exceptional results, surpassing the upper limits of our guidance across all metrics.\nOrganic growth in subscription revenues reached 31%.\nThis level of performance is unmatched in our industry.\nCurrent remaining performance obligations grew by 32%, subscription billings increased by 28%, and operating margin stood at 26%.\nWe have once again increased our full-year forecast, reinforcing our clear trajectory towards $15 billion-plus in revenue by 2026.\nI assumed the role of ServiceNow's CEO over two years ago.\nWe've all witnessed numerous events since then.\nWhat remains unparalleled is the consistent innovation and execution at a global scale.\nAnd we're just beginning.\nBefore Gina provides a comprehensive report, let's discuss ServiceNow's dramatic upward trajectory.\nThe rate of digital investment is growing rapidly.\nIDC has consistently valued this opportunity at $7.8 trillion over four years.\nGiven this vast addressable market, ServiceNow is positioned at the intersection of two generational opportunities: First, the need for new technology infrastructure is intensifying our close collaboration with CIOs.\nA recent Wall Street Journal article emphasized CIOs' role as digital business architects.\nOngoing advancements in public cloud and machine learning are ushering in a new era of software innovation.\nTechnology teams desire a fully integrated software lifecycle: planning, development, deployment, operations, and service.\nServiceNow is spearheading this 20th to 21st century transition for our clients.\nThe Now Platform, with its immense versatility and scalability, has become the control center for digital transformation.\nThe second factor propelling ServiceNow is the reorganization of enterprise application platforms for hyperautomation.\nToday's leaders recognize that their technology architecture is their business architecture.\nOver several decades, enterprises have invested trillions in on-premise and first-generation SaaS applications.\nThese applications met the business process needs of the 20th century.\nModern business models require a fully connected value chain.\nLegacy environments lack the adaptability to enable this change.\nAs the pioneer of modern digital workflows, ServiceNow is leading the renaissance.\nThe Now Platform connects various applications and data sources to create intuitive mobile experiences, all at a consumer-grade level.\nWe don't require businesses to commit entirely to a single system or collaboration tool.\nWe offer choices that unlock value from our platform and other platform investments.\nServiceNow also enables anyone to develop applications on our platform.\nIn its report on low-code development technologies, Gartner predicts that 70% of new applications developed by 2025 will use low-code or no-code technologies.\nGartner also recognized ServiceNow as a leader in its Magic Quadrant.\nThese tailwinds are driving rapid organic growth across our entire solutions portfolio.\nThe number of deals exceeding $1 million reached 63, up 50% year-over-year, indicating substantial adoption of our platform strategy.\nIn Q3, IT workflows remained robust.\nITSM featured in 18 of our top 20 deals, while IT Operations Management had 10 deals over $1 million.\nThe Internal Revenue Service is undertaking a multiyear digital transformation effort.\nIn Q3, they selected ServiceNow to consolidate 12 complex systems into a single platform supporting the agency's mission-critical operations.\nDemand for our entire IT portfolio is strong.\nThe introduction of Lightstep Incident Response in the third quarter is paving the way for new product-driven growth in monitoring and observability of applications.\nHR was a key component in 13 of our 20 largest deals, demonstrating Employee Workflows' exceptional performance this quarter.\nIn the third quarter, NTT Data will utilize the Now Platform to develop a portal for employee experience, boosting productivity in hybrid work settings and managing vaccine distribution for its entire staff.\nCustomer Workflows maintains its momentum, with CSM featured in 12 of our top 20 deals and eight transactions exceeding $1 million.\nOur industry-specific solutions are spearheading progress with major brands.\nVerizon is implementing our telecommunications solution, American Century our financial services solution, and Sunbelt Health our healthcare solution.\nCreator Workflows, which enables companies to develop their own applications, performed remarkably well in the third quarter, featuring in 18 of our top 20 deals.\nWe're collaborating with Stanley Black & Decker to implement ServiceNow's new manufacturing vertical solution with App Engine to revolutionize their customer service approach.\nIn partnership, we're optimizing facility operational time and providing excellent experiences for distributors, dealers, and end-users.\nFujitsu will also broaden its use of the Now Platform to propel its own digital transformation journey.\nWe're immensely proud that Uber, Honeywell, Telia, and numerous others chose ServiceNow in Q3.\nThis represents a comprehensive performance for the company, with robust growth across the Americas, EMEA, and Asia Pacific/Japan regions.\nAs we anticipate a strong conclusion to 2021 and beyond, several factors give us great optimism about this business.\nFirstly, despite the fierce competition for talent, we're greatly encouraged by the record number of professionals choosing to join ServiceNow.\nOur new hires, along with our exceptional global workforce, are fostering a uniquely inclusive, motivated, and content culture.\nWe're also witnessing significant developments in our partner ecosystem.\nJust three weeks ago, we revealed a new partnership with Celonis.\nCelonis will provide process mining insights, ServiceNow will create improved workflows, and our customers will benefit from this integrated approach.\nWe've also strengthened our long-standing partnership with Microsoft.\nServiceNow's Employee Center can now be directly integrated into Microsoft Teams, reaching 250 million monthly users.\nIn collaboration with our expanding partner network, we will simplify processes to enhance work experiences for people.\nLastly, innovation without disruption is a cornerstone of our top-tier engineering tradition.\nBy 'without disruption', we mean imperceptible, offering a smooth upgrade experience for our customers.\nIn our Now Platform Rome release, we introduced numerous new features to customers, including Mobile App Builder, an Automation Discovery tool, Employee Journey Management, and new Customer Service Playbooks.\nEvery business leader globally is contemplating the future of work.\nThese new features equip the Now Platform with even greater capabilities to shape that hybrid future.\nI'll refer to a statement made by industry analyst Josh Bersin, who commented on our Rome Platform release, \"This company appears to be able to develop and deploy enterprise software faster than almost any I've ever seen, which is why they're a powerhouse\".\nJosh, I naturally concur.\nIn conclusion, the company is operating at peak performance.\nThe quarterly results speak for themselves.\nWe exceeded expectations once again and raised our guidance once more.\nThe secular trends are in our favor.\nOur customer base is expanding while our customer NPS is rising.\nOur partner ecosystem is energized.\nWe accelerated our timeline to achieve net zero emissions.\nWe assist businesses in driving their own ESG initiatives on our platform with a major release.\nThe list of achievements continues.\nOverall, our message to the market couldn't be clearer.\nRegardless of your systems, challenges, or opportunities, and however rapidly you need to progress, you have a trusted innovator in ServiceNow.\nWe aim to improve how the world works for everyone, and we'll never lose sight of the privilege that comes with saying, the world operates with ServiceNow.\nGina, I'll hand it over to you.\nThe third quarter was another outstanding period with continued outperformance across all of our growth and profitability guidance metrics.\nDemand was robust globally across all three of our geographical regions.\nThe consistency of our quarterly results demonstrates the robustness of our product range and our team's dedication to fostering strong customer connections.\nThird-quarter subscription revenue reached $1.43 billion, exceeding our highest projection by $22 million and showing a 31% year-over-year increase, including a 1% boost from foreign exchange.\nThe remaining performance obligation concluded the quarter at about $9.7 billion, reflecting a 34% growth compared to the previous year.\nThe current remaining performance obligation was approximately $5 billion, showing a 32% year-over-year increase and surpassing our forecast by 2 percentage points.\nExchange rates had no effect on the year-over-year growth.\nSubscription billings for Q3 totaled $1.38 billion, representing a 28% increase from the previous year and exceeding our highest projection by $55 million.\nForeign exchange and duration provided a 1.5% year-over-year boost.\nWe observed widespread success across the industries we serve, with particularly strong net new annual contract value growth in transportation, logistics, and business services.\nOur Q3 renewal rate of 98% demonstrates the value ServiceNow provides to its customers.\nWe consider our customer relationships as long-term collaborations and continuously innovate to offer new solutions addressing their changing business requirements.\nThis strategy of gaining and expanding customers has resulted in 1,266 clients paying over $1 million in annual contract value, a 25% increase from last year.\nAs our product range and addressable opportunities have grown, so have our deal sizes.\nWe closed 63 deals with over $1 million in net new annual contract value this quarter, an increase of more than 50% compared to last year.\nAll of our top 20 deals in Q3 involved four or more products.\nOur operating margin was 26%, 3 percentage points above our forecast, primarily due to strong revenue performance.\nWe also experienced savings from delayed return-to-work plans and reduced travel expenses.\nOur free cash flow margin was 15%.\nThese results collectively demonstrate the strength of our business model and our ability to balance growth with profitability.\nWe're delivering exceptional experiences that drive strong employee engagement, intense customer loyalty, and significant productivity improvements.\nBy providing more intelligent automation that enhances experiences, we are well-positioned as the workflow standard on our path to becoming a company with over $15 billion in revenue.\nWe are increasing our full-year guidance.\nWe're raising our subscription revenue projection by $32 million at the midpoint to a range of $5.565 billion to $5.57 billion, representing 30% year-over-year growth, including a 2% boost from foreign exchange.\nWe are increasing our subscription billings forecast by $61 million at the midpoint to a range of $6.379 billion to $6.384 billion, representing 28% year-over-year growth.\nExcluding early customer payments in 2020, our adjusted subscription billings growth projection would be 32% year-over-year at the midpoint.\nThis growth includes a net 2% boost from foreign exchange and duration.\nWe continue to anticipate an 85% subscription gross margin for 2021, and we're raising our full-year 2021 operating margin from 24.5% to 25%.\nThis reflects our increased top-line growth and savings from delayed return-to-work plans and reduced travel.\nWe're also raising our full-year 2021 free cash flow margin by 0.5 percentage points from 31% to 31.5%.\nWe expect 202 million diluted weighted average outstanding shares.\nFor Q4, we anticipate subscription revenues between $1.515 billion and $1.52 billion, representing 28% year-over-year growth, with minimal impact from foreign exchange.\nWe expect current remaining performance obligation growth of 27% year-over-year.\nThis includes a 1.5% foreign exchange headwind due to recent sharp movements in the euro and pound.\nOn a constant currency basis, we expect current remaining performance obligation growth to be 28.5%.\nWe anticipate subscription billings between $2.305 billion and $2.31 billion, representing 26% year-over-year growth.\nExcluding early customer payments in Q4 2020, our adjusted subscription billings growth projection would be 32% year-over-year at the midpoint.\nThis growth includes a net 0.5% headwind from foreign exchange and duration.\nWe expect an operating margin of 22%, which includes accelerated demand generation spending in the quarter to set us up for a strong start in 2022, and we anticipate 203 million diluted weighted outstanding shares for the quarter.\nIn conclusion, the pace of digital investment is accelerating, and ServiceNow is rising to seize the opportunities before us.\nOur team has never been more engaged and focused on addressing the significant needs of our customers.\nAs ServiceNow evolves into the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century, we remain committed to creating a positive impact on the world.\nI'm pleased to announce that in September, we committed to achieving our net-zero emissions goal by 2030, twenty years earlier than our previous target.\nWe've never been more proud of our employees and their continued dedication to serving our customers, partners, and communities as we strive to improve not only work processes but also make the world function better.\nOur culture of ambition and humility is stronger than ever.\nSummary: ",

effects from the pandemic and associated governmental measures and their influence on the overall economy, as well as other hazards and uncertainties detailed in our SEC filings, particularly our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q\nDuring the discussion, we will refer to several non-GAAP financial metrics\nFactors such as post-fourth quarter foreign exchange rate fluctuations, interest rate changes differing from guidance assumptions, consequences of further COVID-19 or variant spread, and environmental and legal costs may affect outcomes\nEnPro had a prosperous year as we continued to meet the challenges and seize the opportunities that emerged over the last year\nI will start by presenting financial and strategic overviews for the entire year, after which Milt will provide specifics on our fourth quarter performance\n2021 was another year of transformation for EnPro\nWe persist in successfully restructuring our portfolio and moving towards growth markets with products and services that yield higher margins and cash flow returns\nThe acquisition of NxEdge and the sale of CPI in December, along with the divestment of the polymer components business in the third quarter, represent significant progress in our portfolio restructuring strategy, positioning our company for a promising future\nAs volumes rebounded from the pandemic lows of 2020, we observed positive momentum throughout the organization\nAnnual sales increased by 6.3% to $1.14 billion\nOrganic sales grew by 14.4%\nWe experienced strong demand in most markets, including general industrial, semiconductor, heavy-duty truck, petrochemical, food and pharma, and aerospace\nAdjusted EBITDA of $208.4 million rose by 23.8% compared to 2020\nAdjusted EBITDA margin of 18.3% increased by 260 basis points, primarily due to organic sales growth\nSelect product and pricing actions, along with the net benefit of strategic portfolio reshaping completed in both 2020 and 2021, partially offset raw material inflation and supply chain, labor, and logistics constraints\nAs mentioned last quarter, we anticipate continued raw material inflation and supply chain challenges\nWe expect uncertainty and volatility in the macro environment as we enter 2022\nOur commercial and supply chain teams are continually evaluating all opportunities to mitigate current circumstances while meeting customer needs in a strong demand environment\nWe are realizing substantial benefits from our portfolio reshaping actions, enabling us to capture incremental margin expansion in 2021 while closely monitoring costs and further streamlining our already agile organization\nOur strong order trends persisted during the fourth quarter, and we are starting 2022 with solid demand\nWe continue to observe broad-based strength across our businesses and are encouraged by feedback from our customers, particularly in semiconductor, heavy-duty truck, aerospace, nuclear, and food and pharma markets\nLooking ahead, we continue to invest both organically and inorganically in our Advanced Surface Technologies and Sealing Technologies segments, while driving cost and return improvements in the Engineered Materials segment\nWe will build upon this core industrial technology foundation, now in place, maintaining our focus on margins and cash flow returns\nWe expect to maintain our strong recurring revenue streams with aftermarket revenue across our businesses approaching 50% of total company revenue\nWe remain focused on driving long-term shareholder returns through a disciplined approach to capital allocation supported by our steady cash flows and through our commitment to sustainability and diversity\n2022 marks our 20th year as an independent public company\nAs I begin my first year as EnPro CEO, I am amazed at how far we have come and am extremely excited about what the future holds for all of our stakeholders\nI will now transfer the call to Milt for a more in-depth analysis of our Q4 financial performance.\nDespite widely reported challenges faced by us and others, we experienced another strong quarter.\nQ4 sales reached $280.8 million, showing a 1.7% increase compared to the previous year.\nWe observed robust demand across semiconductor, heavy-duty truck, aerospace, general industrial, and food and pharma sectors, along with contributions from Alluxa and NxEdge acquisitions, which largely counterbalanced the sales reduction due to divestitures and automotive market weakness.\nOrganic sales in Q4 grew by 10.4% compared to the same period in 2020.\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased slightly by 0.8% to $47.7 million compared to the previous year.\nInflationary pressures on raw materials, freight, and labor costs, as well as higher SG&A, negatively impacted adjusted EBITDA, outweighing the benefits from pricing initiatives and reshaping actions completed in 2020 and 2021.\nQ4 2021 corporate expenses rose to $26.9 million from $10.6 million the previous year, primarily due to acquisition-related costs for the NxEdge transaction and increased incentive compensation expenses driven by Q4 share price performance.\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share remained relatively unchanged at $1.23 compared to the previous year.\nAmortization of acquisition-related intangible assets in Q4 increased to $12.7 million from $10.9 million in the prior year, reflecting the additions of Alluxa and NxEdge.\nLet's examine the segment performance for Q4 of last year.\nSealing Technology sales decreased by 7% to $143.9 million due to divestitures.\nExcluding divested businesses and foreign exchange impacts, sales grew by 12% compared to the previous year, driven by strong demand in heavy-duty truck, aerospace, nuclear, and food and pharma markets.\nAdjusted segment EBITDA decreased by 12.3% due to divestitures in 2020 and 2021.\nExcluding divestitures and foreign exchange effects, adjusted segment EBITDA increased by 3% compared to the previous year.\nQuarterly results were affected by inflationary pressures on raw materials, labor, and freight costs, particularly in the trucking business.\nThese costs were offset by pricing initiatives and leverage from organic volume growth in the segment.\nNow, let's discuss Advanced Surface Technologies.\nQ4 sales increased by 38.5% to $69.1 million, driven by strong semiconductor market demand and the acquisitions of Alluxa and NxEdge.\nExcluding acquisitions and foreign exchange effects, sales grew by 16.6% compared to the previous year.\nQ4 adjusted segment EBITDA increased by 35.7% due to acquisitions and strong organic sales growth.\nExcluding acquisitions and foreign exchange impacts, adjusted segment EBITDA grew by 10.4% compared to the previous year.\nEBITDA growth, while strong, was partially impacted by timing delays in advanced node chip launches.\nOur ongoing qualification and production work with semiconductor customers gives us confidence in the organic growth and profitability outlook for our semi business, both in the coming year and long-term.\nIn Engineered Materials, sales decreased by 7.3% due to the divestitures of GGB bushing block and CPI businesses.\nQ4 automotive market sales were weak due to chip shortages affecting auto production, particularly compared to the strong auto market in Q4 2020 and the first half of 2021.\nExcluding divestitures and foreign exchange effects, sales remained flat.\nCompared to the same period last year, fourth quarter adjusted segment EBITDA fell by 21.9%, due to increased raw material costs, supply chain difficulties, and reduced automotive production in Europe and the US.\nWhen not considering divestitures and currency exchange effects, adjusted segment EBITDA decreased by approximately 20.2% compared to the previous year's quarter.\nLet's examine the financial position and cash flow.\nAt the end of Q4, we had $338.1 million in cash, with $310 million located outside the US.\nWe're working on bringing back some of this overseas cash to pay down debt, where it's tax-efficient to do so.\nAs of December 31, we had $213.6 million available for borrowing under our credit facility.\nIn 2021, free cash flow reached $123.2 million, up from $39.3 million the previous year, due to higher operating profits and lower taxes from a refund related to a federal tax audit resolution, partly offset by working capital investments to support increased demand.\nWe paid a $0.27 per share quarterly dividend in Q4.\nTotal dividend payments for the year amounted to $22.4 million.\nOur directors approved an increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.28 per share, starting with the March payment, marking our 7th consecutive annual increase since initiating dividends in 2015.\nRegarding 2022 projections:\nWe anticipate low double-digit revenue growth compared to 2021's reported sales of $1.14 billion, with adjusted EBITDA expected between $263 million and $275 million, suggesting adjusted EBITDA margins above 20%.\nWe project adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to range from $6.70 to $7.25, using a normalized 27% tax rate, down from 30% last year.\nThe lower 2022 tax rate assumption stems from late 2021 portfolio changes that increased the proportion of US earnings.\nOur forecast includes depreciation and amortization expenses, excluding acquisition-related intangible asset amortization, of $37 million to $39 million, and net interest expenses of $30 million to $33 million.\nThe net interest expense estimate accounts for 425 basis point increases in our variable borrowing rate throughout 2022.\nDemand and order trends remain strong entering 2022, despite inflationary raw material costs, omicron variant impacts on labor availability, and supply chain and logistics constraints pressuring early-year growth and margins.\nWe plan to implement additional pricing measures across the company during the year to address inflationary pressures.\nWe continue to monitor the COVID situation and prioritize the safety and well-being of our colleagues, who have shown great resilience during challenging times over the past two years.\nEnPro had an exceptional year.\nI'm proud of our team's achievements in executing our multi-year strategy to transform EnPro into a leading industrial technology company, focusing on our best businesses while investing in markets with faster growth, higher margins, and better cash flow returns.\nOur 2022 guidance suggests adjusted EBITDA margins around 21%, up from 14% in 2019 when we began our portfolio reshaping strategy.\nWe remain committed to delivering strong financial results while supporting our colleagues' development and the communities where we operate.\nOur journey is just beginning.\nWe appreciate

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:In the third quarter of 2020, we recorded a $99 million impairment charge related to an equity method investment.\nWe will discuss the quarterly results without including that charge.\nA complete transcript and download will be available after the call concludes.\nI am pleased to present Norfolk Southern's Chairman, President and CEO, Jim Squires.\nOur third quarter performance was exceptional, setting new records for operating ratio, net income, income from railway operations, and earnings per share.\nDespite flat volume compared to last year, revenue increased by an impressive 14%, and our 60.2% operating ratio shows a 230-point improvement year-over-year on an adjusted basis, marking our second-best OR performance ever, surpassed only by last quarter's 58.3%.\nWe are fulfilling our commitments despite significant nationwide supply chain disruptions and labor shortages.\nThese achievements would not have been possible without the unwavering dedication of our employees, who consistently ensure the safe and efficient movement of our customers' goods.\nLet's have Cindy walk us through our operations.\nThis quarter, we continued to successfully enhance productivity across our network.\nWe strived for maximum efficiency while adapting to demand shifts in various markets.\nThis quarter demonstrates ongoing progress as we tackle our cost structure while positioning ourselves for further improvements in both cost and service quality.\nThe quarterly operating metrics on slide six clearly indicate that we once again generated positive operating leverage on flat unit volumes and a 5% increase in GTMs.\nAlthough we are actively hiring train crews, efficiency improvements across all operational areas, including engineering, mechanical, and communications and signals, allowed us to operate the network with 7% fewer employees compared to the same quarter last year.\nReducing the number of active locomotives was a crucial factor in managing workforce size, as assets drive activity.\nBoth train weight and length continued to improve, driven by a focus on enhancing productivity in our bulk network.\nCoal, grain, and other single commodity unit trains present significant opportunities for improvement through collaboration with customers on operating trains with more cars per set and by combining existing trains for portions of their routes.\nI anticipate further progress in the fourth quarter as we see the results of our efforts.\nWhile strong coal traffic contributed more to train weight than length, train length continued to improve and set another quarterly record.\nAfter seven consecutive quarters of fuel efficiency improvements, we experienced a slight decline this quarter despite the increase in train size, as our horsepower leverage was occasionally challenged due to volatile traffic flows and we had slightly fewer very heavy, highly fuel-efficient trains.\nI am urging the team to respond more swiftly to changes, and we are committed to narrowing the gap with our peers over time, redoubling our efforts in this critical area.\nAs shown on slide seven, train speed and terminal dwell were generally consistent with the second quarter but do not reflect our desired performance levels.\nAlthough Hurricane Ida had some effects, these impacts were localized, and I'm extremely proud of how our team, particularly engineering and signal forces, quickly restored our routes in Louisiana and reopened the New Orleans Gateway.\nAs mentioned last quarter, we are facing increasingly challenging hiring and retention conditions, especially in some of our more critical locations, which is impacting our network.\nDespite ongoing hiring efforts throughout the year, attrition has accelerated in each of the last two quarters in several crucial areas.\nIn many of these locations, we've managed to absorb the impact by implementing productivity initiatives, which will continue to be a significant part of our strategy as we expand capacity, which I'll discuss further shortly.\nWe are taking several actions to address these challenges: we've more than tripled our conductor trainee numbers since the first quarter to effectively backfill critical areas; we've introduced incentives such as perfect attendance bonuses, referral bonuses, and signing incentives to improve retention of our current and future workforce; and we continue to utilize valuable Go Teams to quickly respond to business opportunities when needed.\nOur employees are the foundation of our railroad, and we must make progress on these initiatives to better manage the effects of a tight labor market.\nWe are dedicated to having the appropriate resources in the right place at the right time, which will drive both cost control and service quality.\nAs our business mix continues to evolve, creating capacity across our market segments has become an even more crucial area of focus, as highlighted on slide eight.\nSome shippers aim to capitalize on unexpected market opportunities by shipping additional volume.\nOthers are looking to us to help them adjust to volatility in other parts of their supply chains, and naturally, all place high value on service predictability.\nWe're adapting our network and operations to generate the various types of capacity that customers require.\nFor instance, increases in train sizes provide shippers with extra capacity without further demands on our crew base.\nTrain size increases often require connecting railroads, customers, and Norfolk Southern to modify processes, and we have found that these changes are worthwhile as they improve asset turns and capacity.\nWe also continue to focus on terminal efficiency, whether by helping to reduce dwell times at our largest hump yard, Elkhart, to very low levels or strategically redirecting trains to intermodal terminals that can unload quickly.\nMoving to slide nine, I want to demonstrate how we can use these capacity efforts to drive productivity.\nWe've had great success over the past two years in increasing train size and, in doing so, have addressed several infrastructure bottlenecks.\nWe're expediting a set of siding improvements, the first of which became operational at the end of the third quarter, to continue making progress.\nLarger trains enabled by siding extensions help improve locomotive utilization by allowing us to fully match train size to available pulling power.\nSince locomotives are most efficient when pulling hard, this is a key factor in improving our fuel efficiency.\nWhile I've used locomotives and fuel as my primary example, capacity additions have a similar effect on our crew productivity: more cars per crew, improved asset turns, keeping trains moving with greater train capacity, and also benefiting our customers with enhanced train and car performance.\nOn slide 10, we are complementing our investment in physical capacity with a comprehensive technology strategy that enhances crew efficiency and asset productivity.\nNearly all of our routine signal and track maintenance is now scheduled via the mobile track authority app, transforming a process that used to take minutes into one that can be completed in seconds.\nThis approach is inherently more efficient than the previous radio-based process and, most importantly, safer because it reduces transcription errors.\nAccording to our chief engineer, the app has been transformative for the productivity of his teams.\nWe're implementing a similar approach with our mobile train reporting app, which allows our train crews to quickly report completed work and receive updated customer work requests while en route.\nThis streamlines the process by eliminating multiple steps, including significant retyping and delays, enabling our crews to be more productive.\nThe rollout of this application to local trains responsible for most pickups and deliveries is in its early stages.\nThere are many potential applications for this technology in the field, and promoting its adoption and innovation is a key focus that will enable us to reap additional benefits.\nThe common theme among these applications is that improved information enables better planning.\nTrack supervisors can better organize their schedules knowing when tracks are available, while customers can more effectively plan their plant operations and product pipelines with current shipment data.\nIn Q3, we continued to implement our growth strategy, resulting in double-digit revenue increases across all three of our markets, further showcasing our ability to create value for customers and shareholders.\nStarting with slide 12, I will present our Q3 results.\nOur total revenue reached $2.9 billion, a 14% increase compared to the same period last year, despite unchanged volumes.\nThis quarter's revenue performance was fueled by significant increases in revenue per unit and revenue per unit excluding fuel, both hitting record levels with double-digit year-over-year growth.\nThis reflects the success of our ongoing efforts to improve yields and revenue quality, a strategy that enhances our long-term potential for revenue and margin growth as market conditions improve.\nOur merchandise segment saw a 10% year-over-year revenue increase, while volume grew by 5%.\nThe Chemicals franchise led the growth, benefiting from recovering energy demand that drove higher shipments of crude oil and natural gas liquids.\nStrong steel markets, due to record-high commodity prices and increased manufacturing activity, also contributed to merchandise growth.\nSteel shipments increased by an impressive 34% compared to the same period last year.\nThese gains were partially offset by decreased shipments of finished vehicles and vehicle parts due to the ongoing semiconductor shortage.\nThis limited automotive production and further reduced finished vehicle inventories to new lows.\nBoth revenue per unit and revenue per unit excluding fuel improved year-over-year due to price increases.\nOur intermodal franchise faced several challenges related to supply chain disruptions that negatively impacted volume in both domestic and international business lines.\nIn both segments, unprecedented demand from inventory restocking and consumer spending exceeded available capacity in the supply chain ecosystem.\nDrayage shortages, warehouse productivity issues, equipment availability problems, labor force participation challenges, and rail network fluidity pressures affected intermodal volume throughout the quarter, resulting in a 4% year-over-year decline.\nDespite these challenges, we achieved 16% revenue growth in Q3 due to higher revenue from storage services, increased fuel surcharge revenue, and price strength.\nCoal revenue rose by 32% in Q3 as both domestic and global economies continued to recover from the pandemic, driving demand for electric power.\nExport coal shipments increased significantly as strong demand and record-high seaborne prices created more opportunities for the US.\nUtility volumes declined in Q3 as coal supply was limited and some crossover tons moved into the higher-priced export market.\nThe shift from utility to export coal, combined with price gains, led to a 20% increase in revenue per unit excluding fuel for coal in Q3, setting a new record for the franchise.\nLooking ahead to slide 13, we expect the Q3 environment to persist through the end of the year.\nStrong consumer demand will continue, while material shortages and labor issues will keep global supply chains under pressure.\nInventory levels remain at historic lows despite ongoing efforts to replenish stock, boosting transportation demand.\nWe are confident in our ability to leverage our strengths in these market conditions and deliver robust revenue growth for the full year.\nWe anticipate our merchandise business will continue to benefit from recovering economic activity, as conditions that limited business and recreational activities in Q4 last year have been less impactful in Q4 2021.\nWe expect higher volumes in our markets for crude oil, natural gas liquids, and waste as a result.\nOngoing demand for steel will also drive growth, with industrial production forecasts up more than 5% year-over-year in Q4 and steel prices currently above $1,900 per ton.\nA projected 4% year-over-year decline in US light vehicle production in Q4 will remain a challenge as the industry continues to struggle with the chip shortage.\nIn the intermodal sector, we continue to see strong demand from consumer spending and tightness in the truck market.\nThese favorable conditions are offset by constraints from supply chain congestion and equipment availability.\nWe are collaborating closely with our customers and channel partners to address these challenges.\nHowever, we do not anticipate significant improvement in these headwinds before the end of the year.\nCoal demand is expected to remain strong with extremely favorable market conditions, although coal supply will limit year-over-year growth.\nNatural gas prices continue to rise, and declining inventory levels leading into the winter months are currently the main concern for utility customers.\nSeaborne prices in the export market are at decades-long highs, creating demand that exceeds capacity and supply capabilities.\nOverall, we are optimistic about Q4 opportunities and confident in our ability to execute our plan to generate value and grow our business.\nMoving to slide 14, several factors are impacting the supply chain we operate in.\nThese include external factors such as the chip shortage and increasing congestion in the intermodal supply chain.\nCoal supply availability continues to constrain meeting higher demand in all markets, as both thermal and metallurgical production remain tight.\nNS has taken steps to mitigate some of these factors and effectively position ourselves for revenue growth.\nAs drayage challenges affected international intermodal, we offered an alternative storage solution to our customers.\nWe are working diligently to increase chassis capacity to support demand and alleviate shortages across the supply chain.\nIn the previous quarter, we presented our strategy to fix a section of our chassis fleet affected by a production flaw.\nI'm grateful for our team's swift response and efforts, and I'm happy to announce that this problem is essentially resolved as we have fixed and returned about 95% of the recalled chassis to operation.\nWe are currently in the process of receiving leased chassis to expand our fleet.\nWe have increased terminal capacity to accommodate growth driven by e-commerce and an improving economy, as well as reduced terminal congestion and enhanced network efficiency.\nWe continue to concentrate on growth prospects throughout our network.\nWe are constantly innovating to compete in the $800 billion plus trucking and logistics market, as demonstrated by our Thoroughbred Freight Transfer (TFT) service launched earlier this year.\nTFT is one of our initiatives to drive growth by targeting opportunities to shift highway traffic to rail.\nThis service combines the efficiency of our intermodal trains, the capacity of our boxcar assets, and the flexibility of trucks for last-mile delivery to provide an innovative door-to-door service.\nWe are also utilizing our sustainability advantage to drive long-term growth.\nThe choice of transportation mode is one of the most effective ways for any shipper to reduce its carbon footprint, and we are collaborating closely with our customers to provide additional value through sustainability.\nWe have demonstrated our ability to deliver results despite challenging market conditions by offering innovative solutions that our customers value and position us for future market demands.\nOn slide 16, as Alan just explained, revenues increased by 14% with flat volumes.\nWith operating expenses up 10%, we achieved strong incremental margins leading to a 230 basis point improvement in operating ratio, bringing us to a Q3 record of 60.2%.\nThe improvement in RPU that Alan described, combined with strong productivity, resulted in record Q3 operating income, growing by 21% or nearly $200 million.\nOur free cash flow is also at record levels, increasing by 33% during these nine months compared to the previous year.\nMoving to slide 17, let's examine the changes in operating expenses in more detail.\nWhile operating expenses grew by $149 million or 10%, it's only up 4% or $67 million, excluding fuel cost increases.\nThe $82 million increase in fuel costs is primarily due to price, but the 5% increase in GTMs also led to higher consumption.\nYou'll notice purchase services increased by $35 million, with the majority of the year-over-year increase in certain areas.\nWe have an increase in technology spending, which aligns with our technology strategy, and Cindy mentioned a couple of project examples in her remarks.\nThere are also headwinds from Conrail operating expenses.\nAdditionally, there are increases in intermodal costs.\nSpecifically, we incurred trucking costs for shuttling longer dwell containers to satellite parking lots to reduce congestion at our terminals and keep freight moving.\nLift expenses actually increased in the quarter despite fewer lifts, primarily due to inflation we absorbed on lift rates associated with contractor labor availability.\nWe expect continued inflationary pressure in this area going forward.\nWe also incurred costs related to our chassis repairs during the quarter.\nRegarding compensation and benefits, it increased by 5%, but you'll notice the $40 million in savings from a 7% reduction in headcount that more than offset increases in pay rates and overtime.\nMeanwhile, incentive compensation comparisons in the quarter are a $43 million headwind, similar to what we reported in the second quarter, reflecting our strong 2021 financial outlook compared to lower accrual rates last year.\nMaterials, claims, and other expenses all decreased year-over-year.\nTurning to slide 18 and examining the rest of the P&L below operating income, you'll see that other income of $14 million is $25 million less favorable year-over-year, mainly due to lower net returns from company-owned life insurance.\nOur effective tax rate for the quarter was 23.6%, close to our federal and state statutory rates, unlike Q3 last year when the rate was 21.9% and benefited from tax advantages related to both COLI investment gains and higher stock-based compensation.\nNet income grew by 17%, while earnings per share increased by 22%, supported by the 3.6 million shares we repurchased during the quarter.\nConcluding with our free cash flow on slide 19, as I mentioned, free cash flow is at a record level through the first nine months of 2021 at $2.3 billion, bolstered by very strong operating cash generation, which translates to a 102% free cash flow conversion.\nAlthough property additions are trending slightly lower than the run rate for our $1.6 billion guidance, capital spending is never linear, and we expect fourth quarter property additions will bring us close to the $1.6 billion target.\nWe initially demonstrated our commitment to sustainability by appointing a Chief Sustainability Officer in 2007, the first in the industry.\nSince then, our efforts to support a low-carbon supply chain have significantly accelerated.\nBuilding on the momentum from earlier this year with the approval of our science-based targets for greenhouse gas emissions reduction and our launch of $500 million in green bonds in the second quarter, we're pleased to report another set of milestones in our sustainability journey.\nIn August, we released our 2021 ESG report, our 14th annual report on corporate responsibility, highlighting the transformational role sustainability is playing in our business as we further integrate sustainable practices into daily operations.\nWe celebrated our 500th modernized locomotive unit in partnership with Wabtec in August and announced our collaboration with Progress Rail in September on a first-of-its-kind Tier 4 locomotive prototype for yard and terminal operations.\nEarlier this month, we announced our decision to purchase 100% renewable energy to power company operations in Altoona and Reading, Pennsylvania.\nOur commercial and sustainability teams work closely together to provide demonstrable low-carbon solutions to a wide range of current and potential customers, offering a compelling value proposition as we shift more freight from truck to rail, simultaneously benefiting our customers, communities, and shareholders.\nBefore we open the call for Q&A, I'll briefly update our outlook based on the current economic environment.\nAs previously mentioned, we expect to achieve an operating ratio improvement of over 400 basis points for the full year compared to our adjusted 2020 result.\nThere's likely upside to the 12% year-over-year revenue growth, as strength in our consumer-oriented and manufacturing markets drive most of the growth.\nNear-term upside in coal markets provides a boost for the remainder of the year, although coal remains challenged in the long term.\nWe are delivering on our financial commitments and remain focused on creating long-term sustainable value for our customers and shareholders.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:We thank you for your participation.\nInitially, I will explain the specifics of our financial performance for the third quarter of 2020.\nFollowing that, Paul will discuss the main factors influencing our Q3 results, our expectations for the remainder of 2020, and some general thoughts on 2021.\nI will then return to present our financial projections for the fourth quarter and an updated forecast for the full year 2020.\nWe will conclude the call by taking questions from participants.\nIt's worth noting that some of our discussion may involve non-GAAP financial metrics.\nLet's examine our third quarter results, which showed a 21% increase in adjusted earnings per share to $0.91 and a 13% rise in adjusted EBITDA to $58 million compared to Q3 2019.\nThese outcomes reflect better-than-anticipated performance in worksite employee growth and pricing given the uncertain and challenging business climate, as well as benefits in our direct cost programs resulting from pandemic-related dynamics and the structure and ongoing management of these initiatives.\nRegarding our growth metric, the average number of paid worksite employees in Q3 2020 grew by 1.7% sequentially from Q2 to 231,750, surpassing the upper limit of our projected range.\nYou may remember that employee layoffs in our client base led to a 6% reduction in paid worksite employees from the start of the pandemic in March to the lowest point in May this year.\nSince then, worksite employee numbers have increased sequentially as rehires and new hires by our clients have outpaced any additional layoffs.\nFurthermore, client retention in both Q2 and Q3 has stayed at our typical 99% level, and new client sales continue to add worksite employees.\nGiven these recent positive trends, we now anticipate paid worksite employees will return to near pre-pandemic levels by year-end.\nMoving on to gross profit, it increased by 8% compared to Q3 2019.\nHigher-than-expected worksite employee volume and pricing, combined with advantages in our benefit and workers' compensation programs, resulted in significantly better gross profit than anticipated.\nThis quarter's benefit costs included some positive adjustments from Q2, a period of highly unusual claim activity due to shutdown order impacts.\nAdditionally, healthcare utilization began to trend towards more normal levels in the third quarter, although not to the extent we expected.\nLooking ahead, we anticipate further normalization along with the resumption of some deferred care and COVID-19 testing and treatment costs, though the extent and timing remain uncertain.\nOur workers' compensation program continues to perform well due to ongoing management of safety practices and claims.\nRecent favorable claims development has primarily been associated with periods before the pandemic.\nAny positive impact from reduced severity of workers' compensation claims related to many of our clients' employees working from home would likely benefit our costs in future periods as this claim experience develops over time.\nRegarding our pricing, we charge clients a comprehensive service fee that includes our HR services and direct cost programs.\nWe entered 2020 with certain pricing targets set before the pandemic began.\nWe continued to work towards these budgeted targets.\nAs you may recall, certain savings resulting from pandemic-related disruptions were negotiated with our vendors and passed on to our clients as a comprehensive service fee credit, as reflected in our Q2 financials.\nTurning to operating expenses, Q3 costs included continued investment in growth, including expenses associated with a 10% increase in the average number of trained business performance advisors.\nOther corporate employee headcount has remained stable over the past three quarters due to our staff's effort and effectiveness in handling increased HR service demands from our client base.\nCost savings have been achieved in other areas of the business, such as travel, training, and other G&A expenses, as we navigate the current business environment.\nThe 15% year-over-year increase in total Q3 operating expenses was influenced by higher stock-based compensation costs.\nThis increase was driven by several factors: our outperformance in paid worksite employees and earnings during the pandemic; a shift in weighting towards performance stock awards from performance cash awards for 2020 to better align employee interests with shareholders during challenging times; accelerated expense recognition for employees meeting retirement eligibility requirements under recent plan modifications; and a comparison to the prior year's quarter when earnings and related performance-based compensation were negatively impacted by high healthcare claim activity.\nOperating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation and depreciation and amortization, increased by just 4.6% compared to Q3 2019.\nRegarding our financial position and liquidity, it remains strong as we manage through pandemic conditions, continue investing in growth, and provide returns to shareholders.\nAdjusted cash has grown from $108 million on December 31, 2019, to $213 million on September 30, while we repurchased 1.3 million shares of stock for $91 million, paid $47 million in cash dividends, and invested $69 million in capital expenditures year-to-date in 2020.\nBorrowings increased by $100 million over the nine months, and $130 million remains available under our credit facility.\nToday, I'll address three topics, starting with thoughts on our significant outperformance in the recent quarter.\nI'll then discuss how the primary drivers of our business model responded to the pandemic, resulting in the opportunity suggested by our guidance to achieve double-digit growth in adjusted EBITDA this year.\nLastly, I'll comment on our view of these factors going forward, which will ultimately shape our outlook for 2021.\nWe are certainly pleased with our execution in the third quarter, which led to various factors contributing to better-than-expected results.\nOur client base's resilience, supported by committed service providers and strong sales and retention, led to a notable upturn in sequential growth for our primary metric of paid worksite employees.\nInternal growth in worksite employees within our existing client base surpassed our expectations, with clients rehiring furloughed staff and adding new employees earlier and more rapidly than anticipated.\nAs previously noted, client retention remained at its historical 99% rate, despite the challenging economic conditions facing small businesses in the current climate.\nOur sales bookings since the pandemic's onset have reached about 70% of our pre-pandemic sales targets, which we consider a strong performance given the shift to virtual selling.\nIn the third quarter, paid worksite employees from previously secured sales reached 92% compared to the same timeframe last year, indicating ongoing demand for our offerings and effective onboarding of new clients.\nA notable achievement this quarter was our successful pricing strategy for both new and renewing accounts in service fees and allocations for direct costs, including our benefit packages.\nAligning pricing with direct costs is crucial to our business model, and exceeding our goals in this area is significant as pandemic-related direct costs begin to stabilize.\nWe've successfully continued to expand and enhance our BPA team throughout this quarter.\nWe provided virtual training to over 350 BPAs in our Level 1, 2, 3, and certified Business Performance Advisor programs during this period.\nOur trained BPA count grew by 10% compared to the same time last year, putting us in a strong position for our autumn sales season.\nThis quarter, we redirected some operational cost savings towards creating client testimonial videos and increasing advertising to support our autumn sales campaign and retention efforts.\nThese videos effectively captured the intended emotional impact, showcasing the value of a sophisticated HR function during a crisis.\nWe were able to maintain important technological development beyond addressing the numerous compliance requirements that emerged earlier this year.\nWe're expanding our People Analytics platform, which has been well-received by our mid-market and enterprise clients, to our emerging growth segment, just in time for our crucial renewal period.\nWe continue to make progress in enhancing Insperity Premier, our proprietary human capital management system, introducing a new time and attendance user interface and employing new behavioral analytics tools to guide improvements, making Premier more user-friendly and efficient for clients.\nThe third quarter's bottom line reflected an ideal combination of increased volume and pricing alongside reduced direct and operating costs.\nEach of these factors contributed to our strong performance exceeding expectations for the quarter.\nWe've responded swiftly and effectively to the unusual events of 2020, meeting client needs and achieving growth and profitability beyond our initial expectations.\nWe've also maintained focus on long-term goals, making progress on numerous important initiatives.\nWith three quarters completed and our Q4 estimates in place, we can assess how our business model has performed during the pandemic.\nWhen the pandemic began, we didn't anticipate our business model would have the potential to generate the double-digit growth in adjusted EBITDA that's reflected in our current guidance.\nThe pandemic's impact on our business model ranged from obvious expected negatives to completely unexpected positives.\nIt's worth summarizing these model-driving factors, as the pandemic is ongoing and its effects are likely to extend into 2021.\nOne might assume that a health-related pandemic would increase health costs. However, we've observed that rising COVID cases necessitated protecting hospital capacity and limiting elective procedures, which, combined with people's tendency to avoid hospitals, has actually led to significant short-term declines in healthcare expenses.\nLong-term healthcare costs may rise due to deferred care or expenses related to COVID treatment or vaccines. So far, we haven't seen these cost increases outpace the overall trend, as other factors like telemedicine and some continued care deferral provide offsetting effects.\nFurthermore, many experts, including the CDC, predict that current COVID precautions could significantly reduce flu incidence this year.\nAn obvious negative impact of the pandemic-related lockdowns was the economic effect on small and medium-sized businesses, which affected us through layoffs in our client base.\nWe experienced a roughly 6% decrease in paid worksite employees over two months, followed by a steady four-month recovery, supported by fiscal stimulus and easing restrictions.\nIn hindsight, the CARES Act, particularly the Paycheck Protection Program, was effective in mitigating some layoffs. We believe our swift and effective support in helping clients leverage these programs contributed to fewer layoffs and a quicker recovery.\nThe shutdown effects also highlighted a specific advantage of our business model: our client selection strategy.\nOur risk-based client selection process results in a very small percentage of our client base being in industries most affected by the pandemic and shutdowns, such as entertainment, hospitality, travel, and restaurants.\nAnother surprising outcome, partly due to our client selection strategy, has been the minimal number of business closures within our client base.\nAlthough we anticipated an increase, our strategy of targeting top-performing small and mid-sized businesses across diverse industries provided some insulation from this factor, as we saw no significant rise in business failures.\nAnother dramatic effect we experienced was the increased workload, as many pandemic-related issues fell to HR departments.\nAs mentioned previously, client interactions increased by 300%, and the average duration of these interactions doubled.\nThe workload has quintupled, and while it has decreased somewhat, it remains high.\nConversely, lockdowns resulted in remote work arrangements.\nFor us, this led to enhanced efficiency, with our committed employees performing exceptionally well in meeting the increased demand for our offerings.\nOur observations suggest that remote work is suitable for routine tasks.\nNevertheless, creativity and teamwork might be negatively impacted in the long run.\nA combination of remote and office-based work may provide the best balance of productivity, efficiency, and innovation in the future.\nAn additional benefit of our model during lockdowns and widespread remote work among our clients is a significant reduction in the frequency of workers' compensation claims.\nThis reduction has not yet been reflected in our expenses, but should provide some benefits in future periods.\nHowever, these reduced expenses may be counterbalanced by COVID-related claims that may be covered by workers' compensation in certain states.\nI was pleasantly surprised by our ability to effectively sell our comprehensive and complex service offerings in a virtual environment.\nWe now understand the range of sales efficiency under these circumstances.\nAs we reintroduce face-to-face meetings, we may see a long-term increase in efficiency.\nA final observation is our success in retaining clients during the pandemic, even as financial considerations weighed heavily on our client base.\nOur services proved indispensable, and clients maintained our premium offerings despite the need for budget cuts.\nNow that we better understand the factors influencing our business model during a pandemic, what are the implications for 2021?\nFirstly, planning will depend on these factors and drivers, which are likely to fluctuate based on the pandemic's status.\nWe will closely monitor these new inputs and finalize our budget later than usual to incorporate the most recent information.\nMaking early estimates is impractical given the numerous possibilities, particularly when considering the pandemic's timing and severity or potential mitigating actions.\nFor instance, COVID cases are currently increasing, but one or more vaccines may be available by 2021, or an anticipated economic downturn from additional lockdowns may occur.\nFurthermore, small businesses may receive support from additional fiscal stimulus.\nWe have discovered that our business model has many moving parts and offsetting factors in this environment.\nIf the pandemic worsens, our direct costs may be lower than historical trends, as experienced this year, but growth may suffer.\nConversely, if the pandemic is mitigated or controlled, direct costs may rise, but growth may accelerate as a counterbalance.\nWhat I can say with confidence today is that we have a remarkable organization with the necessary curiosity and intelligence to provide the flexibility and capability to navigate a crisis and achieve impressive results for shareholders, clients, and other stakeholders.\nThis year, we have demonstrated our competence and level of client care in executing matters within our control, along with inspiring ingenuity and resourcefulness in responding to unexpected events.\nWe are certainly pleased with our 2020 results to date and our outlook for the remainder of the year, and we look ahead with confidence in the future, regardless of what we face next year.\nI will now hand the call back to Doug.\nI will now provide our guidance for the fourth quarter and an update for the full year of 2020.\nAs you know, uncertainty persists regarding the pandemic's duration and conditions, as well as the economic trajectory.\nThe current political climate and the timing and details of any further government aid add to this uncertainty.\nWe have considered these factors in our financial guidance for the remainder of 2020 and will take them into account in our budgeting process for the upcoming year.\nWe typically do not offer formal guidance for the upcoming year at this time, so we will consider any further developments in these areas and the outcome of our year-end selling and renewal season when providing 2021 guidance in our next earnings call.\nBased on Paul's recent comments, we continue to anticipate sequential worksite employee growth for the remainder of 2020.\nFor the fourth quarter, we project average paid worksite employees to range from 236,500 to 238,500, a sequential increase of 2% to 3% over Q3 of 2020.\nThis translates to an expected decrease in average paid worksite employees of only 1% for the full year 2020, despite significant challenges for small businesses caused by the pandemic and its economic impact.\nWith an improved outlook for Q4 worksite employee growth, our current pricing strength, and a range of expectations in our direct cost programs, particularly our benefits program, we now forecast Q4 adjusted EBITDA of $21 million to $30 million and adjusted earnings per share of $0.20 to $0.38.\nCombined with our Q3 outperformance, we are raising our full year 2020 earnings guidance and now predict adjusted EBITDA of $271 million to $281 million, an increase of 8% to 12% compared to 2019.\nFor full year 2020 adjusted EPS, we now forecast a range of $4.35 to $4.53, up from our previous guidance of $3.67 to $4.04.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:These are founded on managerial predictions, which may or may not come to fruition.\nFurthermore, some of our statements today refer to non-GAAP adjusted metrics.\nWe anticipate submitting our 10-K document later today.\nAs stated, this conference call is being recorded and will be accessible on our website after the event.\nPlease be aware that these calls are intended for financial professionals.\nIndeed, years pass by, but 2020 was a year unlike any other, as we all recognize.\nThe global health crisis impacted numerous aspects of our everyday lives, and I'm pleased with how our staff united to deliver exceptional service to our clients.\nWe effectively managed various obstacles while still meeting our primary financial and operational objectives.\nOur reported earnings from ongoing operations were $2.30 per share for the year 2020.\nThis was primarily due to robust performance in the gas utility sector and a significant contribution from our newly established water utility division.\nIn terms of gas operations, our field teams successfully handled various challenges, including wildfires, restoring service in multiple towns during the Christmas period, and navigating issues related to COVID-19 and social unrest.\nJust a short while ago, our employees in the natural gas system once again demonstrated their capability by providing reliable service during an extreme weather event.\nOur storage facilities and overall hedging strategies helped to reduce the amount of gas purchased on the spot market and mitigated the impact on our customers' bills.\nThis was particularly crucial as prices spiked across the nation due to the widespread cold weather.\nOur financial position remains robust with sufficient liquidity.\nIn 2020, we also implemented one of the largest capital investment programs in the company's history, aimed at enhancing reliability.\nWe continue to operate one of the most advanced and efficient systems in the country, with no cast iron or bare steel components.\nIn 2020, we invested over $270 million in our natural gas infrastructure.\nFrom an economic standpoint, 2020 was truly extraordinary.\nBefore the pandemic, we had a fundamentally sound and sustainably growing economy with record-low unemployment rates both nationally and in our service areas.\nWe continue to observe economic recovery and steady growth in several key sectors.\nPortland's unemployment rate was 6.1% in December, essentially matching the national rate, down from a peak of 14.9% in April.\nSingle-family housing activity remains robust.\nIn the Portland metropolitan area, home sales increased by 8.3% compared to 2019, with price growth of approximately 12%.\nNew single-family building permits issued last year were up 4% compared to 2019 levels.\nAt Northwest Natural, we continue to experience good customer growth.\nNew construction and conversions resulted in connecting over 13,000 meters during the 12 months ending December 31.\nConsequently, our overall customer growth rate was 1.5% for the same period, driven by strong single-family home construction, partially offset by the loss of some commercial customers due to the pandemic.\nThe distribution of vaccines is expected to ease pandemic-related restrictions and allow businesses to reopen.\nNevertheless, we recognize that these are challenging times for some customers, and we have worked closely with commissions, staff, and stakeholders to determine the best approach for returning to normal business practices.\nWe have agreed on timelines for resuming collection processes and continue to evaluate what makes sense for customers given the economic conditions, while also providing financial assistance and payment plans to vulnerable customers.\nEnhancing the system includes a bill forgiveness program and collaborating with the Oregon Legislature to secure additional funding for bill relief.\nThrough various programs and agencies, we have provided over $4 million to more than 10,000 households to help them pay their bills and stay warm during the last heating season.\nWe also donated approximately $1 million to nonprofits in our communities and initiated a special COVID-19 employee giving campaign.\nFor Oregon, previously approved new rates became effective on November 1 last year.\nGas bills continue to remain low.\nOur customers are currently paying about 40% less for their bills than they did 15 years ago.\nAdditionally, in June, we returned a record $17 million in storage bill credits to Oregon gas customers.\nSafety, reliability, and affordability make natural gas a preferred fuel source.\nAccording to a study conducted in December 2020, eight out of ten homeowners in our service territory prefer natural gas.\nThere is strong recognition that natural gas is affordable, efficient, and preferable to electricity for heating and cooking.\nIn fact, over 80% of respondents stated they would pay $50,000 more for a home with gas amenities compared to an all-electric home.\nCustomers also demonstrated their appreciation by ranking Northwest Natural second among large utilities in the West in the 2020 JD Power residential customer satisfaction survey.\nLastly, our Board approved a dividend increase in the fourth quarter of 2020, marking the 65th consecutive year of annual dividend increases.\nWe are proud to provide returns to shareholders and be one of only three companies on the NYSE with such a long record.\nI will start by discussing the financial impacts of COVID-19 and the highlights of the fourth quarter and full year 2020 results, then conclude with guidance for 2021.\nIn 2020, our utility commissions approved COVID deferrals and term sheets outlining the types of revenues and costs that may be recovered.\nThese include personal protective equipment, bad debt expense, financing costs associated with additional liquidity, and certain lost revenues.\nCost reductions related to decreased travel and entertainment expenses should be offset against the deferral\nThe determination of prudency review and recovery for deferral accounts will be made in upcoming proceedings\nOur business model is strong, but we are seeing some financial effects due to the pandemic\nWe experienced approximately $10 million in pre-tax incremental costs and reduced revenues through December 31 as a result of COVID-19\n$4.8 million of this amount was deferred to regulatory accounts\nWe will recognize $1.3 million in late fee revenue in a future period when we begin recovering foregone fees through rates, as normal collection processes were suspended\nThe remaining $3.8 million that cannot be recovered via rates is mainly due to reduced natural gas utility margin from customers who ended service and slightly lower usage from non-decoupled customers\nWe implemented temporary cost-saving measures to further mitigate the pandemic's financial impact, resulting in about $3.5 million in savings for 2020\nThe total profit and loss impact of COVID-19 in 2020 was $1.6 million\nLet's examine our detailed financial results\nI will explain earnings drivers on an after-tax basis using the 26.5% statutory tax rate\nYear-to-date earnings per share comparisons reflect the June 2019 issuance of 1.4 million shares to fund investment in our gas and water utilities\nNorthwest Natural's earnings are seasonal, with most revenues and earnings generated during the winter heating season in the first and fourth quarters\nFor the quarter, we reported $45.8 million or $1.50 per share in net income from continuing operations, compared to $38.3 million or $1.26 per share for the same period in 2019\nThe gas utility saw a $0.19 per share increase related to new Oregon rates starting November 1, 2020, partially offset by higher depreciation and general tax expense and COVID-19 impacts\nOur other businesses contributed an additional $0.05 per share from newly acquired water assets in Washington and Texas and reduced holding company expenses\nGas distribution segment utility margin increased by $11.5 million due to new Oregon rates and customer growth, partially offset by COVID-19 effects\nUtility O&M decreased by $500,000 in the quarter, reflecting cost-saving efforts\nI'm proud of our employees' hard work and dedication, which allowed us to achieve this while maintaining exceptional service\nDepreciation expense and general taxes increased by $2.9 million due to ongoing system investments\nFor the full year 2020, we reported $70.3 million or $2.30 per share in net income from continuing operations, compared to $65.3 million or $2.19 per share in 2019\nThe 2019 results included a $0.22 per share regulatory disallowance related to an Oregon Commission order on tax reform and pension expense\nExcluding that disallowance, adjusted non-GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations was $2.41 for 2019\nThe $0.11 per share decline is primarily due to year-over-year expense growth, COVID-19 effects, and the positive impact of weather and pipeline constraints on 2019 results\nIn the gas distribution segment, utility margin increased by $11.3 million\nHigher customer rates in Oregon and Washington, customer growth, and revenues from the Northwest expansion project contributed an additional $21.5 million\nThis was offset by lower entitlement and curtailment fees related to 2019 pipeline constraints and warmer weather in the first quarter of 2020 compared to 2019, which collectively reduced margin by $4.5 million\nUtility margin also declined by $1 million due to lower late fee revenues as we suspended normal collection processes\nThe remaining $5.2 million decline in utility margin is a result of the 2019 Oregon order\nWith the exception of the first quarter pension disallowance, this order has no impact on net income as offsetting adjustments were recognized through expenses and income taxes\nUtility O&M and other expenses declined by $5.4 million\nThis decrease is associated with the Oregon order which resulted in $14 million of additional expense in the first quarter of 2019\nThis was offset by a $6 million increase in underlying O&M related to higher compensation costs, contractor and professional service expenses, and moving costs\nThis was partially offset by the management-driven cost savings measures mentioned earlier\nPension expenses, included in other expense, increased by $2.8 million, but this expense is now recovered in rates\nWe have invested in our gas system at historically high levels over the past few years\nAs a result, depreciation expense and general taxes increased by $10.2 million\nUtility segment tax expense in 2019 included a $5.9 million benefit related to the implementation of the Oregon order, with no significant effect on net income\nNet income from our other businesses increased by $2.2 million due to higher earnings from wastewater, water and wastewater utilities and lower holding company expenses, partially offset by lower asset management revenues\nRegarding capital expenditures, we invested $294 million into the business, with $273 million for gas utility capital expenditures and $38 million for water acquisitions\nOur balance sheet remains strong with sufficient liquidity\nConcerning the ongoing effects of COVID-19, about 97% of our commercial and industrial customers are up to date with their bills\nHowever, some commercial customers have gone out of business and shut off their meters due to negative impacts\nWe will continue to closely monitor usage levels and commercial customer losses\nWe will also maintain disciplined cost management to mitigate these circumstances\nLet's move on to our 2021 financial guidance\nCapital expenditures for gas utilities this year are anticipated to range from $280 million to $320 million, encompassing major projects for system enhancement, renovating resource centers across the service area, and upgrading technology.\nThe company has released its 2021 earnings forecast, projecting between $2.40 and $2.60 per share.\nThe forecast assumes ongoing customer expansion, typical weather patterns, and no major shifts in current regulatory policies, mechanisms, outcomes, laws, legislation, or regulations.\nDespite the challenges of the previous year, our priorities remain unchanged: delivering exceptional customer service, maximizing returns from our robust and expanding regulated natural gas utility, and diversifying our portfolio through investments in the water sector.\nWe made strides in our diversification efforts by divesting two investments that were no longer central to our strategy.\nWe sold our stake in the Trail West pipeline project in August, and in December, we finalized the sale of the Gill Ranch storage facility in California.\nThe funds from these sales are expected to be reinvested in our gas and water operations.\nThe events of the past year reaffirmed our decision to establish a water and wastewater utility platform and showcased the value we can bring to this sector.\nOur water and wastewater utilities experienced organic customer growth of nearly 3%, specifically 2.8%, in the 12 months ending December 31, 2020.\nWe also enhanced infrastructure and submitted our first general rate case for our water utility.\nAlthough the COVID-19 pandemic temporarily slowed acquisition activity, we still managed to add a water and wastewater utility in Washington to our portfolio and made our initial acquisition in Texas.\nWe continued to make minor acquisitions within our existing service area while exploring new growth opportunities.\nI remain enthusiastic about the investment potential in this business.\nAnother crucial aspect of our strategy involves actively pursuing a renewable future and working to reduce carbon emissions in our gas utility system.\nBefore delving into our approach, it's crucial to understand our starting point.\nNorthwest Natural serves approximately 74% of residential square footage in our service area and fulfills 90% of our space and water heating customers' energy needs on the coldest days, yet the emissions from this usage account for only 6% of Oregon's total greenhouse gas emissions.\nIn the Northwest, gas and electric systems experience concurrent peaks in winter.\nThe gas system delivers about twice as much energy during peak times compared to the electric system, with even more capacity available.\nThis advantage positions us well to drive decarbonization in the region while ensuring reliability and affordability.\nRecent events have underscored the critical importance of reliability during winter months.\nAllow me to outline three components of our vision for carbon neutrality by 2050.\nFirstly, we plan to continue pursuing aggressive energy efficiency measures to reduce energy consumption.\nOver the past four decades, the number of residential natural gas customers in the US has grown by almost 90%, but demand has remained stable, demonstrating the industry's commitment to promoting efficiency.\nToday, our residential customers use half the amount of natural gas they did in 1970, despite consistent growth in average home sizes and more appliances per household.\nSecondly, we're aiming to incorporate renewable natural gas from various waste streams into our system.\nThe technical potential for RNG supply in Oregon alone is estimated at nearly 50 billion cubic feet, approximately equivalent to all residential gas consumption in our state.\nNationally, early estimates indicate about 14 trillion cubic feet of technical potential, or roughly 88% of total throughput.\nThere's clearly vast technical potential, and now we need to collectively focus on bringing as much as possible to market economically.\nWe also see potential for adding hydrogen to the pipeline.\nWe believe there are three applications for hydrogen from the power-to-gas process: blended, methanated, and dedicated hydrogen systems.\nWe also envision the possibility of blue hydrogen, produced from natural gas and paired with carbon capture, utilization, and storage, playing a role in the US gas system.\nWe're closely monitoring efforts in Europe, Canada, and Australia in this area.\nIn 2019, Northwest Natural sent a technical team to Europe to meet with government agencies, think tanks, and gas companies.\nWe gained valuable insights about new technologies, projects, and policies.\nIt was evident that Europe was several years ahead of the US in considering gas network systems and the role of green molecules in the energy transition we're all facing.\nThey recognize that existing gas infrastructure is a significant advantage, with storage being a prime example.\nNatural gas infrastructure is designed to provide long-duration energy storage that doesn't degrade.\nExisting facilities can store RNG and methanated renewable hydrogen today.\nWhen considering decarbonization strategies across the energy sector, the pre-existing infrastructure and its cost advantages are crucial factors.\nFor instance, Northwest Natural currently has 20 billion cubic feet of underground storage.\nThis is equivalent to storing about 6 million megawatt hours of renewables.\nAt current costs, that would be comparable to a $2 trillion lithium battery.\nThis is where policy plays a key role in helping us leverage our existing infrastructure in new ways and accelerate our region's decarbonization efforts.\nOregon has implemented Senate Bill 98, groundbreaking renewable natural gas legislation that sets 30-year targets for gas utilities to procure RNG and renewable hydrogen for customers.\nWe recently announced our first RNG investment under this bill and are actively working on more.\nNorthwest Natural has begun hydrogen blending tests at our training facility and is collaborating with Eugene Water And Electric Board in Oregon to propose a project that would include methanated hydrogen for our system.\nWe're excited about these initial steps and are committed to pursuing solutions that incorporate system resilience as part of the energy transition.\nNow, more than ever, we recognize the critical role our gas infrastructure plays in advancing our collective climate goals, while ensuring energy system diversification and reliability for the communities we serve.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:These are based on management's projections, which may or may not come to fruition.\nWe anticipate submitting our 10-K form later today.\nThis conference call is being recorded and will be accessible on our website after it concludes.\nPlease be aware that these calls are intended for financial professionals.\nOur company experienced a successful 2021, and we're continuing to enhance our core strengths in our gas and water utilities division, while also launching a competitive renewable natural gas venture.\nWe reported a net income of $2.56 per share for 2021, representing an 11% increase compared to the $2.30 per share net income from continuing operations in 2020.\nThe natural gas utility's results were driven by new rates in Oregon and steady customer growth, while our interstate storage business saw increased revenues.\nThis financial growth is the result of years of effort, a strong focus on our long-term strategy, and evidence that steady progress yields positive outcomes.\nWe're observing positive trends in our local Portland Metro Area economy.\nThe unemployment rate in this region dropped to 3.9% in December 2021, down from 7.3% the previous year.\nThe single-family housing market continues to show significant strength.\nIn 2021, home sales increased by 10% compared to 2020, with average sale prices rising by 16%.\nNew single-family building permits issued increased by 12%, while multifamily permits in Oregon rose by 37% compared to the previous year.\nOur region experienced robust construction and development activity.\nThis resulted in over 11,000 new customers connecting to our gas network in 2021, representing a growth rate of 1.5%.\nOur water and wastewater utilities also experienced continued growth.\nStrong residential construction, primarily in Idaho and Texas, led to a 3% organic customer growth rate.\nWe also completed four acquisitions in 2021.\nMost significantly, we acquired a stake in Oregon's largest privately-owned water company.\nThe combination of organic growth and acquisitions increased our water utility connections by nearly 30% last year.\nOn November 1, updated rates for gas utility customers took effect for the current heating season.\nThis included the impact of the general rate case we concluded in Washington State.\nDespite these increases, our customers are still paying nearly 30% less for their natural gas today than they did 15 years ago.\nThis reflects decreased commodity costs, energy efficiency efforts, prudent expense management, and smart investments in gas storage assets that continue to benefit customers.\nAs a result, natural gas maintains its position as the preferred fuel choice.\nIn addition to its performance benefits, natural gas offers up to a 60% price advantage over electric or oil options for the typical home we serve.\nOur customers are crucial to Northwest Natural's success.\nI'm delighted that Northwest Natural ranked second best among large natural gas utilities in the J.D. Power Residential Customer Satisfaction Study.\nThis continues our nearly 20-year tradition of outstanding results.\nI'm proud of all our employees who deliver this exceptional service every day.\nAs you know, growth isn't always linear, and some years focus on initiatives that set the stage for future growth.\n2022 is such a year for us.\nTo that end, 2021 and 2022 include substantial capital expenditure plans related to critical spending on safety and reliability, technology system upgrades, and cybersecurity investments.\nTo recover these long-planned project costs, we took the necessary step at the end of 2021 and filed a rate case.\nThe request includes a revenue requirement increase of $73.5 million based on a 50-50 capital structure, a 9.5% return on equity, and a cost of capital of about 6.7%.\nWe filed for an increase in average rate base of $294 million since the last rate case.\nThe Oregon Commission and stakeholders have 10 months to review the case, and we expect new rates to take effect on November 1.\nSimultaneously, we continue to make progress under the landmark Oregon Senate Bill 98 legislation, which supports renewable energy procurement and investment by natural gas utilities.\nI'm pleased to report that we signed an agreement with Archaea to procure renewable natural gas on behalf of our customers in the fourth quarter of 2021.\nNorthwest Natural also recently finished commissioning the first of four renewable natural gas projects with Tyson Foods and BioCarbN.\nConstruction on our second facility began this month, with commissioning planned for early 2023.\nTo date, we've signed agreements with options to purchase or develop renewable natural gas on behalf of our customers, totaling about 3% of Northwest Natural's current annual sales volume in Oregon.\nWe've made significant progress in under two years, which fills me with pride.\nCurrently, wind and solar comprise approximately 11% of our nation's total electricity supply after years of investment.\nWe plan to continue taking important measures to increase our renewable energy supply, as we know our customers desire a decarbonized system and clean energy future.\nA recent poll by an independent research firm revealed that 77% of voters in Oregon and Southwest Washington want access to all energy types, including renewables, hydro, wind, solar, and renewable natural gas for a balanced, low-carbon future.\nAbout 78% of voters appreciate the natural gas system's crucial role in reducing emissions while maintaining affordability, reliability, and resilience as top priorities.\nNearly 80% of property owners endorse local government initiatives to promote natural gas usage.\nOur success across all business areas enabled our board to raise our dividend for the 66th year in a row.\nThe current annual indicated dividend rate stands at $1.93 per share.\nWe take pride in providing returns to our shareholders and being one of only three NYSE-listed companies with such a track record.\nI'll start by highlighting our fourth quarter and full year 2021 results, then provide guidance for 2022.\nI'll explain earnings drivers on an after-tax basis using the 26.5% statutory tax rate.\nRemember that Northwest Natural's earnings are seasonal, with most revenues and earnings generated during the winter heating months in the first and fourth quarters.\nWe reported a net income of $40.5 million or $1.32 per share for the quarter, compared to $45.8 million or $1.50 from continuing operations in the same period of 2020.\nThe decrease in net income compared to last year was primarily due to our gas utility's performance, which saw a $0.15 per share decline in earnings.\nOther businesses experienced a $0.03 per share decrease in earnings, mainly due to higher business development costs.\nThe gas utility's lower earnings were primarily attributed to increased operations and maintenance and depreciation expenses, partially offset by new rates in Oregon and Washington.\nThe gas distribution segment's utility margin rose by $4.5 million due to new rates and customer growth.\nUtility O&M increased by $5.7 million, reflecting higher expenses for payroll and benefits, contractor and professional services, and IT upgrades.\nUtility depreciation and general taxes increased by $1.6 million due to higher property, plant, and equipment investments in our system.\nFor the full year 2021, we reported a net income of $78.7 million or $2.56 per share, compared to $70.3 million or $2.30 per share from continuing operations in 2020.\nThis $0.26 per share increase was driven by both the gas utility, which contributed an additional $0.16, and our other businesses, which added $0.10 per share.\nThe gas utility's higher earnings were primarily due to new rates in Oregon and Washington, along with customer growth.\nUtility margin increased by $30.7 million, with higher customer rates and growth contributing $30.9 million.\nThis was partially offset by a loss from the gas cost incentive sharing mechanism due to purchasing higher-priced gas during the February 2021 cold weather event.\nUtility O&M increased by $14.2 million, driven by higher employee compensation and benefit costs, lease expenses for our new operations and headquarters building, and increased costs related to IT system upgrades.\nDepreciation and general taxes rose by $9 million.\nNet income from our other businesses increased by $3 million, largely due to higher asset management revenues from the February cold weather event.\nCash provided by operating activities in 2021 was $160 million, a $15 million increase compared to the previous year.\nWe invested $300 million into the business, primarily for gas utility capital expenditures.\nOur balance sheet remains strong with ample liquidity.\nRegarding 2022 financial guidance, gas utility capital expenditures are expected to range from $310 million to $350 million, including significant projects related to system reinforcement and technology upgrades.\nThese capital investments, along with higher forecasted expenses for technology and payroll, supported our decision to file the Oregon rate case with rates effective in November this year.\nIn line with these business drivers, we initiated 2022 earnings guidance today for net income ranging from $2.45 to $2.65 per share.\nThis guidance assumes continued customer growth, average weather conditions, and no significant changes in prevailing regulatory policies, mechanisms, outcomes, or legislation and regulations.\nWe continue to see solid long-term growth in our natural gas and water utilities.\nAs discussed last quarter, we've launched our competitive renewable natural gas business.\nAs a result, we're now targeting a long-term earnings-per-share growth rate of 4% to 6% from 2022 to 2027.\nWe made significant progress on our business strategy this past year.\nOur focus moving forward is clear: maximizing returns from our strong and growing regulated gas utility and positioning our business for incremental long-term growth by investing in water utilities and the competitive renewable natural gas business.\nWe'll maintain our focus on the future, making sound investments today to ensure sustainable growth for tomorrow.\nTo that end, we released our Destination Zero scenario report for the gas facility in November last year.\nThis report illustrates different possible scenarios to transform into a carbon-neutral energy provider by 2050.\nKim Heiting, our senior VP of operations, will soon provide details about this work.\nWe believe a diverse energy system offers greater affordability, reliability, and resilience.\nRecent events in Texas and California demonstrate the advantages of having dual energy systems.\nThe electric and gas networks are interdependent in serving communities, each offering unique benefits.\nThese systems complement each other, with overhead wires delivering renewable electricity and underground pipes transporting renewable gases.\nThis diversity helps address various energy needs and will become more crucial as climate change brings increased weather risks.\nNow, I'll hand it over to Kim for more information on the Destination Zero analysis.\nOur Destination Zero study builds upon our 2016 customer carbon savings goal and the 2019 E3 study on Paris Climate Accord targets for 2050.\nWe've since enhanced our carbon modeling capabilities and considered new developments to refine our system's potential.\nThis new study examined multiple scenarios using existing technologies, some more advanced in Europe, all of which we're actively pursuing or evaluating.\nWe modeled three scenarios using supply and demand-side strategies to achieve carbon neutrality for our sales customers' energy use and future growth.\nThese scenarios incorporate varying levels of renewable natural gas, clean hydrogen, synthetic gas, improved energy efficiency, gas heat pumps, hybrid heating systems, and limited offsets and carbon capture.\nWe used different assumptions to test our ability to achieve carbon neutrality under various conditions and future technology adoption rates.\nThe most probable scenario will likely combine efficiency improvements and reduced carbon intensity in our energy delivery.\nAll scenarios depend on supportive policies to lower costs for innovations like renewable or clean hydrogen.\nNorthwest Natural and our industry are focusing on promoting such policy support.\nWhile our analysis continues to evolve, we maintain our vision of a transformed gas system distributing renewable molecules, enabling our region to achieve its climate goals reliably, resiliently, and affordably.\nI'm proud of our team's efforts, and under Kim's leadership, we're well-positioned.\nThis is likely one of the first comprehensive decarbonization scenario reports by a gas utility, serving as a crucial planning tool for continued progress.\nIn addition to transitioning our gas utility to a renewable future, we launched a competitive renewable natural gas strategy last year, forming Northwest Natural Renewables, a new non-regulated subsidiary.\nThis new organization demonstrates our commitment to leading the energy transition and providing renewable natural gas to various sectors.\nWe aim to offer cost-effective decarbonization solutions using existing waste streams and renewable energy resources.\nWe're at the beginning of a historic energy system transformation and expect continued growth in demand for renewable fuels.\nWe anticipate a significant increase in renewable natural gas demand to meet voluntary and compliance-driven targets set by states and utilities.\nWe see promising investment potential in RNG, aligning with our core competencies and sustainability efforts.\nWe're an attractive partner for developers and feedstock owners seeking a reliable, long-term strategic collaboration.\nMost RNG projects are appropriately sized for us to effectively manage and provide meaningful growth and cash flow.\nWe've already taken initial steps with a 20-year RNG supply agreement and a $50 million investment.\nI'm pleased to announce that Mike Kotyk joined our team in late January to lead our competitive RNG efforts, bringing over 25 years of sector experience.\nWe're prepared and resourced to pursue these opportunities.\nWe'll remain disciplined and focused as we evaluate additional RNG investments to support the energy transition and enhance company earnings and cash flow growth.\nRegarding our water utility business, we've solidified our strategy and quintupled our customer base through nearly 20 acquisitions across four states since our initial transaction four years ago.\nWe've signed purchase agreements that will more than double our total connections.\nWe've also signed our largest acquisition to date, acquiring Far West Water and wastewater utilities in Yuma, Arizona, serving about 25,000 customers.\nWe're pleased to expand into our fifth state in a fast-growing region.\nThe acquisition, pending regulatory approval, is expected to close in Q4 this year and be earnings-accretive after the first full year of operations.\nWe recently announced agreements to acquire two water utilities near our existing Texas systems.\nStrong relationships with regulators are crucial in the water utility business, and we've received support for industry consolidation and investment recovery.\nWe're excited about this business's investment potential and anticipate more announcements soon.\nIn conclusion, our company is financially strong, and opportunities in renewables and water sectors have allowed us to increase our long-term earnings-per-share growth rate to 4-6%.\nWe'll continue pursuing sustainable growth on your behalf.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Go to Page 3.\nSimilar to other financial institutions, we encountered several pandemic-related obstacles in Q2.\nAt OFG, we also dealt with the aftermath of January's earthquakes and the ongoing integration of Scotiabank while facing the COVID-19 crisis.\nThis was undoubtedly a significant challenge.\nThrough swift and proactive measures, we achieved outstanding outcomes for our clients, communities, and staff, continuing to assist them in improving their financial prospects.\nIn March, authorities in Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands ordered the closure of businesses and restricted personal activities.\nLimitations were relaxed towards the end of May.\nHowever, recent increases in COVID-19 cases have prompted Puerto Rico to reimpose some restrictions.\nThe Federal Reserve reduced interest rates by 150 basis points in March, following a 75 basis point cut in the latter half of 2019.\nOur dedication and readiness allowed us to effectively handle these obstacles easily, quickly, and efficiently, as we say at OFG.\nAll our locations operated safely throughout the quarter, supported by our technological infrastructure.\nOur fully-equipped ATMs and ITMs, smartphone application, and internet bill payment services enabled contactless routine transactions.\nWeb and mobile appointment booking facilitated COVID-safe customer meetings at branch locations.\nWe implemented a fully digital, user-friendly application and fund distribution process for PPP loans.\nApproximately half of our workforce continues to work remotely.\nWe also introduced comprehensive new safety measures for our on-site customers and employees.\nWe continued to offer additional benefits to our staff, such as free on-site COVID testing, daily online health check-ins, and incentives.\nThe outcomes are evident.\nWe delivered exceptional customer service, safety, and expertise across all channels.\nSecond quarter loan originations exceeded $500 million.\nCustomer deposits grew by $760 million.\nOur online loan deferment tool and call centers processed relief for over 44,000 retail clients.\nWe decreased higher-cost wholesale funding, maintained a robust net interest margin, and continued to strengthen liquidity and capital.\nWe secured $100,000 in Federal Home Loan Bank of New York grants to assist local non-profits and small businesses in Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands.\nProceed to Page 4.\nWe've observed strong technology adoption trends among our retail and business clients since the start of the year, particularly since March.\nOnline bill pay registrations increased by 12% as of March and 24% as of June.\nMobile banking users increased by 17% from the beginning of Q1 to the end of Q2.\nThe number of remote deposit capture users rose by 68% since the end of March.\nAnother success for us was scheduling over 18,000 COVID-safe appointments with our customers through our online and mobile platform during Q2.\nWe are delighted to observe these trends.\nTechnology is a fundamental component of our overall corporate strategy.\nWe are exploring fresh and innovative approaches to utilize it for the benefit of our clientele.\nKindly refer to Page 5.\nRegarding our SBA PPP initiative, we are consistently surpassing our market share in Puerto Rico.\nWe issued a total of $286 million in additional loans.\nThis allowed us to assist over 4,000 small enterprises in preserving more than 50,000 jobs.\nIt also facilitated our acquisition of new accounts within this strategically crucial customer segment.\nWe were capable of distributing these funds electronically within five days of application acceptance.\nThis exemplifies our capacity to swiftly adapt to changing circumstances, benefiting both existing and new customers, as well as the communities we serve.\nLet's examine our results on Page 6.\nWe announced earnings of $0.39 per share, and $0.37 on a non-GAAP basis.\nTotal core revenues amounted to $128 million.\nThis was largely attributed to a substantial increase in interest-earning assets, mainly loans and cash.\nThis was partially counterbalanced by a decline in yield due to significantly reduced rates on cash and lower yields on variable-rate commercial loans.\nFurthermore, we have reduced investment security balances.\nConsequently, we produced net interest income of $105 million with a net interest margin of 4.78%.\nBanking and wealth management revenues totaled $23 million.\nNon-interest expenses were $86 million, primarily due to the incorporation of the Scotiabank acquisition.\nThe second quarter results encompassed several items.\n$9.5 million in revenues from Scotia Bank interest recoveries and bargain purchase gain.\nWe allocated an additional $5 million in provision for the pandemic.\nWithin non-interest expenses, we incurred $5 million in merger and restructuring charges and COVID-related operating costs.\nPlease proceed to Page 7.\nThe outcome of these results is that we're increasing tangible book value, and our return on assets and return on equity continued to improve sequentially from the fourth quarter.\nKindly turn to Page 8 for operational highlights.\nAverage loan balances grew 52% year-over-year and 2% quarter-over-quarter.\nAverage core deposits, excluding brokered, increased 76% year-over-year and 5% quarter-over-quarter.\nLoan generation was robust.\nEnhanced production from PPP and other commercial loans was partially offset by reduced production in our retail categories, primarily due to the economic shutdown.\nWe concluded the quarter with strong momentum and promising pipelines in the mortgages and auto businesses.\nLoan yield at 6.97% remained relatively stable despite recent Federal Reserve cuts.\nThe cost of core deposits decreased by 4 basis points year-over-year.\nNet interest margin declined to 4.78%.\nRefer to Page 9 for an assessment of credit quality.\nThe rates of net charge-offs and non-performing loans decreased both annually and quarterly, reflecting loan repayments and deferral effects.\nThe provision for credit losses remained steady at $18 million compared to the previous year.\nIt's worth mentioning that last year's provision included an additional $9 million for loans moved to held-for-sale status.\nPlease review our loan deferrals on Page 10.\nIn response to economic disruptions caused by COVID-19, we implemented various loan payment deferral programs lasting from one to four months.\nWe've enhanced this initiative by swiftly developing innovative, industry-leading digital tools to assist consumers in applying for individual forbearance.\nOur digital loan deferral platform and call centers provided relief to over 44,000 retail clients.\nIn total, approximately $1.4 billion or 32% of our retail loans are currently deferred.\nThe frequency of retail deferral requests has significantly decreased.\nAdditionally, about $685 million or 26% of our commercial loans are on deferral.\nPlease refer to Page 11.\nThe allowance for loan and lease losses rose by $70 million year-over-year to $233 million.\nWe've nearly doubled our reserve levels since December 31, 2019.\nCompared to March 31, 2020, the allowance grew by $2 million.\nExcluding SBA-guaranteed PPP loans, the second quarter 2020 allowance was 3.49% of loans, an increase of 8 basis points from the first quarter.\nPlease examine Page 12.\nOur capital position is robust.\nAs shown on the slide, our CET capital ratio of 12.03% has increased by 112 basis points since last year.\nKindly turn to Page 13.\nDespite ongoing uncertainties regarding COVID and the economy, we maintain a strong financial position, ready to support our customers during these challenging times.\nOnce we overcome this situation, Puerto Rico is poised to benefit greatly from COVID stimulus and remaining undistributed funds from Maria and earthquake-related stimulus programs.\nAt OFG, we believe our performance and track record demonstrate our ability to swiftly respond and adapt to changing economic conditions.\nDuring the second quarter, we continued to build momentum in our core businesses and developed a promising pipeline of new loans.\nFrom liquidity, capital, and balance sheet perspectives, we are well-positioned both financially and strategically.\nOur future agenda is clear.\nWe aim to complete the integration of former Scotiabank operations by the end of this year.\nSimultaneously, we must realize the full benefits of the acquisition by the end of 2021.\nWe also plan to continue investing in the future to further streamline our operations and enhance our customer service capabilities.\nUltimately, we intend to play a significant role in the recovery of Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands.\nCrises bring out the best in people, inspiring them to help others.\nOur team demonstrates this sense of purpose every day.\nWe will now open the call for the Q&A session.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:During today's call, we'll address certain non-GAAP metrics when discussing Omnicom's performance.\nJohn will provide an overview of our business, followed by Phil's review of our quarterly financial results.\nWe're delighted to announce continued year-over-year double-digit growth in our key financial metrics for the third quarter, driven by strong top-line performance.\nOur impressive top-line results were consistent across our agencies, geographical locations, and areas of expertise.\nOur CRM Precision segment showed particularly impressive growth at 24%.\nThe CRM Precision Group assists clients with MarTech transformation, digital and e-commerce communications, and direct-to-consumer marketing strategies.\nThis group has been instrumental in many of our recent successful new business acquisitions, contributing to our strong momentum in Q3.\nImproved economic conditions fueled growth across our entire organization.\nOmnicom's range of services and capabilities position us competitively in the market to: enhance and reinvent our clients' brands, seamlessly connect them with customers throughout their marketing journey, upgrade their marketing technology platforms, and innovate in e-commerce and emerging media channels.\nOur strong revenue performance positively impacted our operating profit and bottom line.\nOur third-quarter EBIT margins of 15.8% surpassed our 2020 margins and significantly outperformed the same period in 2019.\nThe quarter's net income and earnings per share grew by over 13% compared to 2020 and were substantially higher than our 2019 results.\nAs we approach the fourth quarter, we are in a strong competitive position and anticipate benefiting from continued global economic growth and ongoing cost management.\nWe currently project our full-year organic growth to be around 9% and our full-year EBIT margin to exceed our year-to-date margin of 15.1% for the nine months ending September 30, 2021.\nMoving forward, we remain committed to our key strategic initiatives, focusing on our talent, creativity, and enhancing our already robust capabilities in precision marketing, MarTech consulting, e-commerce, digital and performance media, and predictive data-driven insights.\nWe made progress on these strategic initiatives in the third quarter with three acquisitions.\nOmnicom Media Group acquired Jump 450 Media, a performance marketing agency that uses algorithmic scaling strategies, rapid creative testing, and data analytics to optimize digital media spend and drive customer acquisition.\nJump 450 will serve as the foundation for a dedicated performance media platform within OMG, enhancing its existing performance media offerings with a focus on e-commerce and pure performance marketing.\nIn late September, we also acquired two German-based companies: antoni and OSK.\nantoni, one of Europe's most innovative and creative agencies, was established with data and digital capabilities at its core and will significantly strengthen our European and global capabilities.\nOSK, consistently ranked in Germany's top 10 PR and communications agencies since 2008, is the undisputed leader in automotive PR and offers a wide range of services at the intersection of PR and social media, excelling in the convergence of technology, mobility, and communications.\nOur ability to combine top talent and data-driven consumer insights from across our organization to deliver comprehensive and integrated brand experiences is proving highly successful in new business opportunities and in serving existing clients.\nFollowing Philips' selection of Omnicom as their global integrated service partner for creative and media communications, Mercedes-Benz appointed Omnicom as their global marketing communications partner in the third quarter.\nTMX, a dedicated team from across our groups, will bring together the best talent and capabilities across Mercedes-Benz's customer journey, offering expertise in media, CRM, brand and performance creation, web personalization, content automation, public relations, events, and paid and organic social media.\nLast week, we won the Chanel media business globally, adding another iconic global brand to our portfolio.\nIn all our significant wins and for existing clients, our teams showcase our creativity, superior analysis, predictive insights, and technology capabilities to deliver connected, personalized, and seamless brand experiences for customers at all touchpoints of the consumer journey.\nA key differentiator for Omnicom in serving our clients is our cohesive culture that unites us, characterized by creativity, flexibility, and caring values shared across our group.\nClients often cite our people's ability to bring distinct specialized skills while knowing, respecting, and genuinely collaborating with one another as a deciding factor in choosing Omnicom.\nOur ability to integrate services across marketing disciplines is supported by Omni, our open operating system that orchestrates better outcomes.\nOmni is designed for collaboration, acting as a conductor between different specialists using a single processing workflow from insights to execution.\nIt empowers our people and clients to make better and faster decisions, maximizing efficiency and ROI.\nOmni also provides enhanced intelligence by orchestrating first-, second-, and third-party data sets to present a comprehensive view of consumers.\nOur teams can then develop insights to create, plan, and deliver the most impactful messages, content, and communications at each stage of the consumer journey.\nOmni is a unique and powerful tool for us, with over 40,000 Omnicom colleagues provisioned on the platform in more than 60 countries.\nHundreds of our clients, including all of our top 20, utilize Omni.\nThe open-source system allows our practice areas like commerce, health, and PR to customize Omni with different data sources for their clients.\nFor example, Omnicom Health Group created a custom offering called Omni Health, which has played a key role in expanding the group's omnichannel offering with new and existing clients since its April launch.\nIn conclusion, even during the pandemic, we enhanced the strength of our services, capabilities, and organization to deliver better outcomes for our clients and win new business.\nOur offering is powerful and differentiated.\nOur organization boasts exceptional talent and innovation, utilizing cutting-edge systems and technologies.\nThis approach will continue to yield success for our company.\nDuring one of the most challenging periods in recent memory, our team has demonstrated remarkable creativity, adaptability, and resilience.\nWe maintain our commitment to investing in comprehensive training and development programs for all employees, ranging from foundational skills to advanced courses at Omnicom University.\nWe have recently broadened the scope of our diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives and OPEN2.0 strategies.\nAs the ongoing pandemic poses significant health risks, the wellbeing of our staff remains our highest concern.\nWe are implementing measures to ensure a secure work environment and offering various programs to support employee wellness, resilience, and health in the workplace.\nI recently visited several of our offices in the U.S. and Europe, meeting with numerous colleagues and clients who expressed satisfaction about returning to the workplace.\nWe are exploring various options to facilitate a safe return to office for our employees.\nAs an example, we are currently piloting a private transportation service for our New York City-based staff this week.\nIn the coming months, we anticipate welcoming more employees back to the office, maintaining our focus on their safety and flexibility.\nOur world-class talent and commitment to creativity and innovative solutions are the driving forces behind delivering tangible business results for our clients.\nA recent testament to the quality of our talent is Omnicom's recognition as the Most Effective Holding Company in the U.S. according to the 2020 [Technical Issues] report.\nWe are extremely satisfied with our performance in the third quarter.\nI am pleased to see that our strategic focus and decisions made during the pandemic are now yielding positive outcomes.\nOur results once again demonstrate Omnicom's ability to adapt to market changes and perform well across economic cycles.\nWhile the pandemic's effects are still felt globally, its impact has significantly diminished, as evidenced by our continued growth in the third quarter.\nThe third quarter shows improvement across our income statement, with revenue growth and cost control leading to an 8% increase in operating profit.\nOur effective tax rate for the third quarter was 24.1%, lower than our estimated rate of 26.5% to 27% for 2021.\nThis reduction was primarily due to favorable resolutions of uncertain tax positions in certain jurisdictions, resulting in an approximate $10 million impact.\nThese factors positively affected net income and diluted earnings per share, which reached $1.65, up $0.20 or 13.8% compared to Q3 last year and $0.33 higher than the third quarter of 2019.\nThis key metric continues to show growth.\nOur quarterly dividend of $0.70, increased in February, is 7.7% higher than last year.\nOur total revenue growth was 7.1%.\nOrganic growth for the quarter reached 11.5% or $367 million, a significant improvement compared to Q3 2020 when the pandemic caused an organic revenue decline of 11.7%.\nCurrency exchange rates increased our revenue by 1.6% in the quarter as the dollar weakened against most major currencies compared to the previous year.\nIf exchange rates remain at their October 15 levels, we expect foreign exchange to decrease our reported revenue by approximately 1% in the fourth quarter and increase it by 2% for the full year.\nThe impact of net acquisitions and dispositions decreased revenue by 5.9%.\nBased on transactions completed through September 30, 2021, we estimate that the net impact of our acquisition and disposition activity for the rest of the year will decrease reported revenue by approximately 7% in the fourth quarter and 4% for the full year.\nWhile we continue to evaluate our business portfolio as part of our strategic planning, we are largely finished with dispositions, as John has mentioned.\nAdvertising, our largest discipline accounting for 53% of total revenues, achieved 8.6% organic growth with strong performance from both creative and media agencies.\nNote that reported Advertising growth is down 0.4%, primarily due to the disposition of ICON in Q2 2021.\nOur agencies focused on direct, digital, and marketing transformation consulting services in our precision marketing discipline also posted strong organic growth at 24.3%.\nExcept for the second quarter of 2020, this discipline has shown consistent growth and has become a larger portion of our business each quarter.\nCRM Commerce and Brand Consulting grew by 18%, led by our branding agencies.\nCRM Experiential increased by 50%.\nThis business declined more than our other disciplines in the third quarter of last year during the pandemic and has not yet recovered to pre-pandemic levels due to various global restrictions.\nHowever, this remains an important area for our clients, and we anticipate further growth as global economies continue to lift social distancing restrictions.\nCRM Execution & Support grew by 8.3%, reflecting a recovery in client spending compared to the previous year in our field marketing businesses, while our research businesses continued to lag.\nPublic Relations increased by 10.5%.\nWe have a positive outlook for this discipline, especially within our global agencies, as clients adjust to post-pandemic realities.\nOur Healthcare discipline grew by 6.6% organically.\nHealthcare was the only one of our service disciplines that maintained positive organic growth during the height of the pandemic and continues to perform well.\nAll of our geographic regions again posted solid organic growth.\nVirtually every discipline within each region contributed to this expansion.\nIn regions outside the United States, overall organic growth reached 16%.\nGermany, the UK, Canada, and Australia spearheaded double-digit growth across all regions.\nOur advertising, media, and public relations agencies performed exceptionally well with double-digit growth, while our precision marketing agencies made significant contributions and also achieved strong double-digit growth.\nFurthermore, experiential growth outside the United States more than doubled in total.\nIn the United States, we achieved 7.7% organic growth, bolstered by strong double-digit growth in our precision marketing and public relations disciplines, as well as solid performance from our healthcare agencies.\nI'd like to present one final perspective on revenue, which can be found on Slide 7, categorized by industry sector.\nCompared to last year, there was minimal change in the sector mix of the portfolio on a year-to-date basis.\nIn conclusion, our revenue performance was robust across all areas, whether analyzed by discipline, geography, or industry sector, on both a reported and organic basis.\nTo enhance the relevance of our analysis, we've included an additional slide in the appendix that displays the 2021 figures in constant currency.\nStarting with our largest category, salary and service costs.\nThese expenses increased by 7.6% overall and tend to vary in line with revenue changes.\nIt's worth noting that Q3 2020 salary and service cost figures were reduced by $68.7 million due to reimbursements from government programs.\nLooking ahead, we anticipate a favorable outlook for advertising and marketing spending, and strong client demand will necessitate increased staffing.\nThe competitive labor market will present short-term challenges, but we are confident our management teams will overcome them.\nProceeding down the profit and loss statement.\nThird-party service costs, which fluctuate with revenue changes, decreased by 6.9% during the quarter due to our net disposition activity, primarily related to the ICON divestiture, partially offset by organic revenue growth and foreign currency exchange rate effects.\nOccupancy and other costs, which are not directly tied to revenue changes, rose by 4.5% year-on-year, or 2.9% when excluding foreign exchange rate translation impacts.\nAs anticipated, these positive results continue to reflect our efforts to reduce infrastructure costs and also benefited from decreased general office expenses as most of our staff continued to work remotely in Q3.\nSG&A expense levels increased by 5.3% year-over-year, or 4.2% when excluding foreign exchange rate translation impacts.\nWe are beginning to see a resurgence of travel and certain other addressable spend costs as pandemic-related government restrictions ease.\nHowever, based on our use of technology during the pandemic, we're developing practices, particularly regarding travel, that we expect will allow us to retain some of the benefits achieved in reducing addressable spend during the pandemic.\nOverall, we anticipate that the increase in addressable spend for the remainder of the year will be partially offset by the benefits we will continue to realize from a hybrid and flexible workforce.\nAs we consider future expense levels, we certainly expect some areas to increase in line with our business as activity picks up and life returns to normal.\nHowever, we will also continue to explore ways to improve efficiency throughout the organization by focusing on real estate portfolio management, back-office services, procurement, and IT services.\nWith the strong revenue growth discussed earlier, combined with effective expense control, you can see a significant improvement in our operating profit on a year-over-year basis at the bottom of the slide, up 8% for the quarter and 60.1% year-to-date.\nIncreasing our operating profit dollars remains one of our top priorities.\nThis robust growth in operating profit was accompanied by improved margins, which can be seen on Slide 9.\nFor the third quarter, our operating profit margin was 15.8% in terms of our reported total revenues.\nWe continue to observe year-over-year operating margin improvement, resulting from proactive management of discretionary addressable spend cost categories, including reduced travel and related expenses, lower costs for operating our offices due to the continued remote work environment, and benefits from some of the repositioning actions taken in the second quarter of 2020.\nLastly on this slide, our reported EBITDA for the quarter was $560.3 million, up 7.4% for the quarter and 56.3% year-to-date.\nEBITDA margins also remained strong for the quarter and have expanded significantly year-to-date compared to last year, and we expect this strong performance to continue through the rest of this year.\nLet's now examine our cash flow performance on Slide 10, which shows that in the first nine months of 2021, we generated $1.2 billion of free cash flow excluding changes in working capital, a $114 million or 10% increase compared to the same period last year.\nThere were no significant year-over-year changes in capital expenditures or acquisitions as we continue to manage our cash conservatively.\nWhile stock repurchases have decreased relative to pre-pandemic periods due to curtailment during the pandemic, we resumed our activity during the second and third quarters of this year, and we expect to continue in Q4 and beyond.\nYou should not anticipate a change in our historical approach to capital allocation and the use of our free cash flow in the future.\nWe will maintain an attractive dividend.\nWe have indicated an increased focus on acquisition opportunities and are in the process of finalizing several acquisitions.\nImportantly, our acquisition strategy targets the faster-growing disciplines in our portfolio and aims to drive future organic growth for the company.\nWe will use the remaining free cash flow to repurchase our stock.\nOur strong cash generation has once again enhanced our credit and liquidity, as summarized on Slide 11.\nOur total debt has decreased by approximately $500 million since this time last year as we eliminated the extra liquidity we added early in the pandemic.\nWe achieved this through the early retirement in Q2 of $1.25 billion of our 3.65% senior notes, which were due next year, partially replaced with the issuance of $800 million of 2.6% 10-year notes due in 2031.\nAs shown in the slide, our maturities are well-distributed with nothing due until late 2024 as we have deleveraged to pre-pandemic levels.\nRegarding our debt ratios, due to our overall operating improvement compared to Q3 of 2020 and our recent refinancing activity, we've reduced our total debt-to-EBITDA ratio to 2.2 times and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio to 0.4 times.\nBoth metrics have improved substantially over the 2020 levels.\nWhile these are just two points in time, it's important to remember our long-term track record of delivering solid returns to shareholders through business execution and the resulting consistent allocation of capital to dividends, strategic acquisitions, and share repurchases.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:We will include comparisons to our 2019 results due to COVID-19's significant impact on our business in 2020.\nI'd like to remind everyone of Oxford's fundamental operational principles before discussing the third quarter results.\nOur goal is always to create long-term value for shareholders.\nWe aim to achieve this by maintaining a collection of influential lifestyle brands capable of generating consistent, profitable growth.\nOur mission, both as a company and within each of our brands, is to bring joy to people.\nWe're pleased to report record-breaking sales and earnings for the third quarter of fiscal 2021.\nThese exceptional outcomes are directly linked to our brand portfolio's strength, the quality of our products, and our ability to engage with and serve customers across various channels, combined with our teams' excellent work in reinforcing these core elements during the pandemic.\nOur sales grew by 41% compared to the same quarter last year.\nMore significantly, our sales also increased when compared to pre-pandemic levels in fiscal 2019.\nNet sales increased by 15% over the same period in fiscal 2019, excluding Lanier Apparel, which effectively ceased operations during the third quarter of fiscal 2021.\nThe substantial sales growth we experienced in the third quarter was driven by a 40% increase in our full-price direct-to-consumer business, with all our brands showing growth compared to fiscal 2019, including a 13% rise in full-price retail and a 100% increase in full-price e-commerce.\nRestaurant sales also contributed to our improved top-line, growing 14% in the third quarter of fiscal 2021 compared to the same period in fiscal 2019, driven by strong increases at existing locations and the addition of five new Marlin Bar venues.\nConcurrently, adjusted gross margin rose impressively by 710 basis points to 62% during the third quarter of fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2019.\nScott will soon provide more details on these excellent metrics.\nHowever, I'll mention that they resulted in record third-quarter earnings of $1.19 per share on an adjusted basis, compared to an adjusted loss of $0.44 per share last year and adjusted earnings per share up $0.10 during the third quarter of fiscal 2019.\nWhile our third-quarter results undoubtedly benefited from a robust consumer market, we believe the main driver of our outstanding performance was the effective execution of our strategy and purpose.\nThe closure of Lanier Apparel during the third quarter marked a significant milestone in our long-term strategy, as Lanier was the last of our legacy private label businesses.\nOur current portfolio comprises five exceptional lifestyle brands: Tommy Bahama, Lilly Pulitzer, Southern Tide, The Beaufort Bonnet Company, and Duck Head.\nThese brands are entirely focused on the consumer and making them happy through powerful, clear brand messages, exceptional differentiated products, superior customer experiences (including our e-commerce websites, stores, and restaurants), and strategic wholesale accounts.\nOver the past two years, across our brands, we have intensified our commitment to conveying our positive, upbeat brand messages through beautiful creative content and imagery.\nThese brand messages are resonating with our consumers and are a significant factor in the excellent results we are achieving.\nThe predominant mix of direct-to-consumer, expected to account for over 80% of our business, enhances our ability to bring happiness to our customers.\nThe direct model provides us with considerable agility and flexibility in managing the flow of products to our customers.\nThis flexibility has proven particularly valuable this year, as industry-wide supply chain challenges have required our merchants to be highly adaptable regarding the products featured on our floors and websites at any given time.\nThe direct business also offers significant margin power and is responsible for a large portion of the gross margin gain we achieved during the quarter.\nLastly, the direct-to-consumer model allows us to deliver an unparalleled customer experience that aligns with the aspirational positioning of our brands.\nOur exceptional staff has consistently delivered top-notch service despite the hurdles faced over the past two years.\nIn recent years, we've focused on improving our digital marketing by enhancing data analysis, generating consumer insights, creating targeted campaigns, and evaluating their effectiveness to grow our customer base, maintain loyalty, and increase overall spending.\nI'm happy to report that customer metrics for the 12 months ending in the third quarter of fiscal 2021, including total customers, new customer acquisition rate, retention, and customer lifetime value, were all robust compared to pre-COVID figures.\nIn terms of product offerings, we continued to see high demand for the relaxed, comfortable styles characteristic of our brands.\nNotable examples include ongoing popularity of Tommy Bahama knitwear and shorts, women's loungewear and sleepwear, and Lilly Pulitzer's Luxletic athleisure line.\nSimultaneously, we observed a welcome revival in previously struggling categories tied to social events, such as men's trousers and button-up shirts, and women's dresses, as people resumed social activities.\nAs we approach the year's end, I'm delighted to announce that holiday sales have been strong so far, and I'm confident we'll conclude an exceptional year on a high note.\nI'm deeply appreciative of our team and share their sense of accomplishment in what we've achieved for our customers and shareholders.\nAs Tom mentioned, our brands performed exceptionally well in the third quarter, resulting in significant growth in sales, gross margin, operating margin, and earnings, surpassing pre-pandemic levels.\nDemand for our products remained high, with revenue exceeding 2019 figures in our direct-to-consumer channels and across all our brands.\nExcluding Lanier Apparel, which effectively ceased operations during the third quarter of fiscal 2021, consolidated sales grew by 15% to $243 million.\nWe saw improvements across all regions, with particularly strong performance in Florida, the Southeast, and Texas.\nHawaii has shown overall positive results, with strength in most areas except Oahu, which relies more heavily on international tourists compared to other islands.\nOur gross margin continued to significantly outperform 2019 levels.\nOn an adjusted basis, gross margin in the third quarter expanded by 710 basis points over 2019, reaching 62%.\nThis improvement was driven by a higher proportion of full-price sales, a shift in our sales mix towards higher-margin direct-to-consumer distribution channels, and improved initial markup (IMU).\nIncreased freight costs, including air freight expenses, partially offset some of the margin gains by approximately 270 basis points.\nOn an adjusted basis, we achieved 260 basis points of SG&A leverage in the third quarter, improving from 56% of sales in 2019 to 53% of sales in 2021.\nAdjusted SG&A dollars decreased slightly from 2019 levels, with reductions in employment costs due to headcount cuts and lower occupancy expenses partially offset by increased marketing spending.\nAs a result, our consolidated operating margin expanded by 970 basis points, from 1% in 2019 to 11%.\nTommy Bahama, Lilly Pulitzer, and Southern Tide all experienced operating margin expansion.\nRegarding our balance sheet, our liquidity position remains strong.\nWe concluded the third quarter with $188 million in cash and short-term investments, with no outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility.\nFIFO inventory decreased by 17% compared to fiscal 2020, excluding Lanier Apparel, due to higher-than-expected sales during the first nine months of 2021, ongoing improvements to enterprise order management systems, and cautious seasonal purchasing.\nWe believe our inventory is well-positioned to meet projected demand throughout the remainder of the holiday selling season.\nLooking forward, we are pleased with our holiday season performance thus far and are confident in our ability to deliver a strong fourth quarter.\nOur perspective is based on our anticipation of ongoing robustness in premium direct-to-consumer operations\nWe anticipate growth in premium direct-to-consumer sales and an overall increase in gross margin compared to 2019\nAlthough we've improved our yearly forecast, the year-on-year enhancement in our premium direct business is anticipated to be somewhat counterbalanced by several specific factors in the fiscal year's final quarter\nWe anticipate Lanier Apparel sales to be roughly $20 million less than the fourth quarter of 2019, as we discontinued the business in this year's third quarter\nFurthermore, we expect our branded wholesale business to be approximately $15 million lower than 2019\nThis is affected by the change in timing of certain initial spring wholesale deliveries\nThese have typically been shipped in the fourth quarter, but are expected to be delivered in the first quarter of 2022, as we reduced our dependence on air freight for warm weather products\nWe also anticipate the Lilly Pulitzer fourth quarter flash clearance event to be smaller compared to 2019, due to strong full-price sales throughout the year resulting in less inventory available for the flash sale\nFor the fourth quarter, we project sales to range between $285 million and $295 million, in comparison to $298 million in sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019\nTo reiterate, Lanier Apparel generated $20 million in net sales in the fourth quarter of 2019\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we anticipate adjusted earnings of $1.20 to $1.35 per share, compared to adjusted earnings of $1.09 per share in the fourth quarter of 2019\nOur forecast includes robust quarter-to-date performance with a promising start to the holiday shopping season\nFor the entire year, we now project sales to range from $1.127 billion to $1.137 billion, compared to sales of $1.123 billion in 2019\nFor the full year, Lanier Apparel sales are expected to be $25 million in 2021, compared to $95 million in 2019\nAdjusted earnings per share are projected to be between $7.52 and $7.67\nThis is in comparison to adjusted earnings of $4.32 per share in 2019\nOur predicted effective tax rate for the entire fiscal year 2021 is approximately 22%\nWe persist in backing our business with investments for future expansion\nCapital expenditures are anticipated to be between $35 million and $40 million in fiscal 2021, primarily reflecting investments in IT initiatives, new Marlin Bars, and retail locations\nWe're thrilled to inaugurate our first company-owned Beaufort Bonnet Company store in Grand Boulevard at Sandestin later this quarter\nWe continue to generate robust cash flow from operations, including $157 million year-to-date\nOur capital allocation priorities include investing in our businesses, acquisitions, and returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases\nWe remain well-positioned to return cash to shareholders and are proud of our long-standing history of providing value through dividends, which we have distributed every quarter since going public in 1960\nThis quarter, our Board of Directors has declared a dividend of $0.42 per share\nAdditionally, in evaluating our capital allocation strategy, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase authorization of $150 million\nSummary: ",

of PCA.\nJoining me on this call are Tom Hassfurther, who oversees our Packaging division as Executive Vice President, and Bob Mundy, our CFO.\nThese are undoubtedly the most uncertain and extraordinary times we may ever face in our lives.\nThere's no guidebook for navigating a public health emergency with such severe economic consequences as the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThis situation will inevitably alter our daily routines, customs, personal choices, professional and social activities, and numerous other aspects of our lives permanently.\nUnder various state and local shelter-in-place directives, PCA's operations are classified as essential or critical.\nOur executive team is in ongoing discussions about safety measures, operational status, business continuity, and other crucial management issues.\nAt PCA, our primary duty is to ensure the welfare of our over 15,000 employees and their loved ones.\nWe must also do our utmost to support our customers and suppliers.\nWe've enacted various safety protocols and protective measures at all our manufacturing, processing, and office sites nationwide to safeguard our employees while providing goods and services deemed essential for the country's pandemic response.\nWe've also implemented measures to help our employees cope with the financial impacts resulting from these response efforts.\nSo far, we haven't experienced any major disruptions in our operations or supply chain due to the virus.\nPCA's strategically positioned network of mills, processing facilities, and distribution centers across the United States provides us with operational flexibility to produce and ship products to multiple destinations.\nWe will maintain close monitoring of developments, take proactive steps to protect our workforce, and continue supplying our customers with necessary products and services.\nI am immensely proud of the dedication, responsiveness, and sacrifices demonstrated by all PCA employees, as well as our customers and suppliers.\nIt has truly been an inspiring sight to witness.\nI'll then conclude, and we'll be happy to address any questions.\nYesterday, we announced first quarter net earnings of $142 million, or $1.49 per share.\nThe first quarter net income included special item expenses of $0.01 per share, mainly related to costs associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.\nExcluding special items, our first quarter 2020 net income was $143 million or $1.50 per share, compared to $187 million or $1.98 per share in the first quarter of 2019.\nFirst quarter net sales remained steady at $1.7 billion for both 2020 and 2019.\nThe company's total EBITDA for the first quarter, excluding special items, was $311 million in 2020 and $371 million in 2019.\nDisregarding special items, the $0.48 per share decrease in first quarter 2020 earnings compared to the same period in 2019 was mainly due to lower prices and mix in our Packaging and Paper segments, reduced Paper segment volumes, higher annual outage expenses, increased depreciation, other expenses, and a higher tax rate.\nThese factors were partially offset by increased Packaging segment volumes, lower operating and converting costs, reduced freight and logistics expenses, and decreased interest and nonoperating pension expenses.\nThe results exceeded our first quarter guidance of $1.20 per share by $0.30, primarily due to higher volumes in both Packaging and Paper segments, improved prices and mix in the Packaging segment, and lower operating costs resulting from excellent fiber and energy usage and reduced input prices at our mills.\nFreight, logistics, and converting costs were lower than anticipated, as were annual outage costs and other expenses.\nLet's examine our Packaging business performance.\nEBITDA, excluding special items, was $290 million in Q1 2020 with $1.5 billion in sales, resulting in a 20% margin, compared to $334 million EBITDA and $1.5 billion sales with a 23% margin in the previous year\nOur containerboard mills set a new Q1 volume record while conducting scheduled annual maintenance at four locations\nWe maintained our industry-leading integration rate of about 95% by providing containerboard to our box plants, which achieved record total box shipments and a new Q1 daily shipment record\nWe met higher-than-expected demand through proactive management, adjusting maintenance outage schedules, and excellent execution during these outages\nThe machine conversion at Wallula Mill enhanced our ability to optimize mix, freight and logistics costs, inventory levels, and customer needs within the containerboard system\nContainerboard inventories reached their lowest levels since acquiring Boise's packaging business in 2013\nDemand for corrugated products and containerboard was robust during the quarter\nOur corrugated products plants set a new all-time record for total box shipments, up 5.6% from last year, and a new Q1 record for daily shipments, up 3.9% compared to Q1 of the previous year\nExternal sales of containerboard were 13% higher than Q1 of last year, mainly due to increased domestic demand and slightly higher export demand\nDomestic containerboard and corrugated products prices and mix were $0.54 per share lower than Q1 2019 and $0.06 per share down from Q4 2019\nExport containerboard prices decreased by about $0.10 per share compared to Q1 of last year and remained unchanged from Q4 2019\nTurning to our Paper segment\nQ1 EBITDA, excluding special items, was $42 million with sales of $217 million, resulting in a 19% margin, compared to Q1 2019 EBITDA of $55 million and sales of $240 million, or a 23% margin\nQ1 paper prices and mix were lower than last year as anticipated, but remained stable compared to Q4 2019\nPaper volume was lower as expected, primarily due to scheduled maintenance at our Jackson, Alabama mill, but was about 3% higher than anticipated\nDespite ending the quarter with slightly lower inventory than planned, we announced downtime at our Jackson, Alabama mill for May and June to manage supply according to Q2 demand outlook\nThe mills excelled in managing fiber and chemical usage and maintained strict control over indirect and fixed expenses throughout the quarter\nWe achieved record Q1 cash generation with $237 million from operations and record Q1 free cash flow of $166 million\nMain cash uses in the quarter included $71 million for capital expenditures and $75 million for common stock dividends\nWe finished the quarter with $764 million in cash on hand, or $913 million including recently moved marketable securities\nOur liquidity of over $1.2 billion as of March 31 is the highest ever for our company\nWith the Q4 2019 refinancing, we have no debt maturities for the next 3.5 years\nThe estimated Q2 financial impact of our decision to idle the Jackson, Alabama paper mill in May and June is approximately $30 million or $0.24 per share\nI'd like to provide an update on our full year guidance for certain items mentioned in last quarter's call\nWe managed strong Q1 demand in our Packaging business partly by adjusting the timing and scope of scheduled maintenance outages at our containerboard mills\nThere are no changes to the scheduled outages at our white paper mills\nThe actual Q1 impact was $0.22 per share, with estimated impacts of $0.09 per share in Q2, $0.16 in Q3, and $0.34 per share in Q4 for the rest of the year\nOur previous projection of $0.81 per share for the full year remains unchanged.\nWe now anticipate our full year interest expense to be $88 million instead of $81 million.\nWe've revised our net cash interest estimate to $92 million from $84 million, mainly due to lower expected interest income.\nWe've slightly reduced our cash tax rate forecast from the earlier 19% estimate, partly because of the announced downtime at our Jackson mill, while our effective tax rate stays around 25%.\nAfter carefully examining our capital expenditure plans, we're maintaining our previously stated spending range of $400 million to $425 million, as well as our full year outlook for pension contributions and depreciation.\nThese are possibly the most unpredictable and extraordinary times we'll ever face.\nEvery day brings new and unexpected impacts we've never considered before.\nOur long-standing strategy of cautious capital allocation and robust financial management has been beneficial for many years and is particularly valuable in current circumstances.\nPCA entered this uncertain period caused by the COVID-19 pandemic with a strong financial position and solid balance sheet.\nOur priority has been and will continue to be maintaining this strength through our management team's actions and decisions.\nAs Bob noted, our company's liquidity is at an all-time high, and we've never been more confident in PCA's future success.\nWe're well-equipped to navigate whatever challenges lie ahead while meeting the needs and expectations of our employees, customers, suppliers, and shareholders.\nHowever, this confidence doesn't translate to the same level of short-term predictability or specific guidance we usually provide at this time.\nDue to the uncertain extent and duration of the pandemic, as well as the timing of global recovery and economic normalization, we're unable to accurately quantify our guidance for the second quarter.\nWe've announced measures for our Paper business, which we believe will position us appropriately for what we currently anticipate in the second half of 2020.\nHowever, nothing is certain, especially now, and further action may be necessary.\nWe experienced a surge in demand for our Packaging business in the first quarter, and the second quarter has also started very strong.\nOur containerboard inventory is at its lowest levels, both in total and in weeks of supply, since we acquired the Packaging business from Boise.\nWhile recycled fiber prices began rising significantly during the first quarter, our position as a primarily virgin fiber producer minimizes its impact compared to other manufacturers.\nIt's logical to expect that demand in certain end markets will eventually return to more normal growth trends, although we've successfully secured new business in end markets with stronger demand outlooks compared to markets that may be more negatively impacted.\nIt's impossible to predict what additional health-related measures will be required or mandated by various state and local governments where we operate.\nSuch events and actions could negatively affect the operation of our facilities and the availability of services and products from our suppliers.\nNevertheless, it's important to note that our company's products are essential for response efforts, recovery, and the well-being of our country.\nThe need for our cost-effective, sustainable, and renewable products will persist.\nWhile no one can predict the severity or duration of the virus's impact on the global economy, I believe this need will be even greater as the world recovers from this crisis.\nThese statements were based on current estimates, expectations, and projections of the company, and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including economic trends and those identified as risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC.\nSummary:

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Following Tom Dineen's presentation of the third quarter 2021 financial results, I will provide insights into our operations and market conditions.\nCopies of these records can be acquired by reaching out to the company, the SEC, visiting ruger.com/corporate, or accessing the SEC website at sec.gov.\nWe make use of the non-GAAP metric EBITDA.\nTom will now present the company's performance for the third quarter of 2021.\nIn Q3 2021, the company achieved net sales of $178.2 million and earnings per diluted share of $1.98.\nThe previous year's comparable period saw net sales of $145.7 million and earnings per diluted share of $1.39.\nFor the initial nine months of 2021, the company reported net sales of $562.7 million and earnings per diluted share of $6.64.\nThe same period in 2020 yielded net sales of $399.6 million and earnings per diluted share of $3.31.\nThe significant improvement in Q3 profitability compared to Q3 2020 was mainly due to increased sales and production, leading to better utilization of fixed costs such as depreciation, engineering, and indirect labor expenses.\nProfitability declined from Q2 2021 primarily due to three factors: First, all firearms facilities took a well-deserved week-long shutdown in July, reducing workdays to 59 compared to 64 in Q2.\nThis production decrease led to lower sales and some unfavorable fixed cost absorption.\nSecond, after a relatively quiet Q2, COVID-19 cases in our plants tripled in Q3.\nThis resulted in considerable production losses.\nThird, following six quarters of exceptional demand, excess resales decreased from Q2, negatively affecting our overall profitability.\nOur robust financial performance generated substantial cash.\nIn the first nine months of 2021, we produced $117 million in cash from operations.\nWe reinvested $15.6 million into the company through capital expenditures.\nWe anticipate 2021 capital expenditures to reach approximately $20 million, primarily for new product development.\nOur ability to relocate manufacturing equipment between cells and facilities enhances overall utilization and reduces capital investment needs.\nAs of October 2, 2021, our balance sheet remained robust.\nOur cash and short-term investments, held in U.S. Treasury bills, totaled $192.7 million.\nWe had a current ratio of 3.8:1 and were debt-free.\nOur shareholders' equity totaled $338.1 million, equivalent to a book value of $19.21 per share, with $10.95 per share being cash and short-term investments.\nDuring the first three quarters of 2021, we distributed $45.2 million to our shareholders through dividend payments.\nThe company's Board of Directors announced a quarterly dividend of $0.79 per share for shareholders on record as of November 15, 2021, to be paid on November 30, 2021.\nShareholders will have received a total of $3.36 in dividends per share for 2021 after this $0.79 quarterly dividend is paid.\nAs a reminder, our quarterly dividend fluctuates each quarter as it is approximately 40% of net income.\nThis concludes the financial summary for the quarter.\nThe demand for our products has continued to be robust.\nWe managed to ship all manufactured firearms this quarter without resorting to aggressive promotions or discounts, despite a slowdown in overall industry demand as shown by the adjusted NICS figures for the last two quarters.\nWe've recently begun restocking distributor and retail inventories, which were largely depleted over the past year and a half, positioning us favorably for the typically high-demand fourth quarter.\nThe estimated unit sell-through of the company's products from independent distributors to retailers grew by 9% in the first nine months of 2021 compared to the same period last year.\nFor the same timeframe, the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) checks, as adjusted by the National Shooting Sports Foundation, decreased by 11%.\nThe company's product sell-through increase outperformed the decrease in adjusted NICS background checks, potentially due to strong consumer demand for Ruger products, increased production in 2021, and the introduction of popular new products.\nInnovation in product development continues to drive our success.\nThe MAX-9 pistol and the Ruger LCP MAX pistol, both launched in 2021, continue to be in high demand.\nIn the first three quarters of 2021, new product sales accounted for $116 million or 22% of firearm sales, compared to $88 million or 24% of firearm sales in the same period of 2020.\nIt's worth noting that our new product sales metric only includes major products introduced in the last eight quarters.\nWe don't include derivatives, extensions of mature product lines, or models introduced more than two years ago in this metric.\nWe are currently working on some exciting new product initiatives, including the reintroduction of Marlin lever action rifles, which we plan to start shipping later in the fourth quarter.\nSince March 2020, our workforce has grown by 370 people, an increase of just over 20%, while our quarterly unit production has risen by more than 160,000 units or 45% during the same period.\nThis represents a 20% increase in personnel resulting in a 45% increase in production.\nOur operations teams at all manufacturing plants have achieved a remarkable feat.\nAlthough production increased towards the end of Q3 2021, our finished goods stock remained near record lows, and Ruger product inventories at distributors were 150,000 units less than pre-pandemic levels in late 2019.\nFollowing an unprecedented 16-month period of intense product demand and continuous monthly production increases, we implemented a week-long shutdown in early July, as Tom mentioned earlier.\nThis marked our first shutdown in two years, allowing our workforce a well-deserved rest and enabling us to conduct routine maintenance and reorganize some manufacturing operations.\nThe shutdown impacted our third quarter production, sales, and earnings, but it was a small sacrifice to make.\nIt was the appropriate decision, and I'm pleased we took that action.\nOur committed and industrious staff deserved and required a break.\nFollowing the shutdown, we are better equipped for what we anticipate will be a busy fourth quarter and 2022.\nSince the COVID-19 pandemic began in March 2020, we have been proactive in safeguarding our employees' health and minimizing its impact on our operations.\nWe grant all hourly workers extra paid time off and offer incentives for vaccination.\nWhen feasible, we allow employees to work from home.\nWe maintain strict cleaning, sanitizing, and social distancing measures to ensure a cleaner and safer work environment.\nAs COVID-19 cases and positivity rates rise again in the United States, we remain alert and are proactively adjusting our strategies to protect our associates' health and safety while minimizing business disruptions.\nOur strong financial position, demonstrated by our debt-free balance sheet, provides us with financial security and flexibility as we navigate challenges like COVID-19 and focus on our long-term objectives and creating shareholder value.\nDuring Q3, we acquired a 225,000 square foot facility in Mayodan, North Carolina, approximately 1.5 miles from our original Mayodan building purchased in 2013.\nThis new facility doubles our presence in Mayodan and allows for future expansion.\nWe relocated our finished goods inventory, ShopRuger operations, and customer service call center to the new facility.\nThis freed up manufacturing space in our original building, in addition to the available space in the new facility.\nThese are the key points from the third quarter of 2021.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:We thank you for your time and interest in Raymond James Financial.\nPaul Reilly, Chairman and CEO, and Paul Shoukry, CFO, are joining us for this call.\nPlease direct your attention to the second slide.\nThese statements cover various topics including future goals, business outlook, financial projections, expected benefits of acquisitions, integration success, litigation outcomes, regulatory changes, pandemic impacts, and economic conditions.\nWe advise you to review the risks outlined in our latest Form 10-K, subsequent Forms 10-Q, and Forms 8-K, available on our Investor Relations website.\nToday's discussion will include non-GAAP financial measures to provide insights into our management's view of ongoing business performance.\nI'd like to begin by apologizing for repeatedly using the word \"record\" throughout this presentation.\nThe year and quarter were truly exceptional.\nOur advisors and associates deserve the credit for these outstanding results, not management.\nTheir commitment and resilience throughout the fiscal year was remarkable.\nWe've once again demonstrated that our client-first approach and excellent service to advisors and clients can guide us through uncertain times, achieving record-breaking results.\nThese exceptional outcomes wouldn't have been possible without everyone's efforts.\nOur fiscal fourth quarter concluded a record-breaking year in many aspects.\nThe company reported unprecedented quarterly net revenues of $2.7 billion and net income of $429 million, or $2.02 per diluted share, reflecting the September three-for-two stock split.\nExcluding $10 million in acquisition-related expenses, adjusted quarterly net income was $437 million, with adjusted earnings per diluted share at $2.06.\nThe increase in quarterly net revenues was primarily due to record-breaking investment banking revenues and assets under management fees, mainly from higher private client group assets in fee-based accounts.\nThe quarter's annualized return on equity was 21.3%, with adjusted annualized return on tangible common equity at 24.1%, an impressive result considering the near-zero interest rates and our strong capital position.\nWe concluded the quarter with unprecedented total client assets under administration of $1.18 trillion, up 27% year-over-year and 1% sequentially.\nWe also achieved record PCG assets in fee-based accounts of $627 billion and financial assets under management of $192 billion.\nOur focus on supporting advisors and clients through advanced technology solutions and a client-centered culture has resulted in exceptional advisor retention and recruitment to the Raymond James platform across our multiple affiliation options.\nWe ended the quarter with a record 8,482 financial advisors, net increases of 243 over the previous year and 69 from the preceding quarter.\nDuring the fiscal year, we recruited financial advisors with approximately $330 million in trailing 12-month production and about $54 billion in client assets to our domestic independent contractor and employee channels.\nIn the Private Client Group, advisors generated domestic net new assets of roughly $83 billion in fiscal 2021, representing 10% of domestic PCG assets at the fiscal year's start, reflecting our excellent retention and record recruitment.\nNew account openings and advisor productivity were also strong this year, contributing to the excellent net new asset results.\nRaymond James Bank experienced impressive loan growth during the quarter, increasing 5% sequentially to a record $25 billion, driven by securities-based loans to Private Client Group clients and strong corporate loan growth.\nThe Private Client Group achieved record quarterly net revenues of $1.8 billion and pre-tax income of $222 million, with a 12.3% pre-tax margin showing significant operating leverage over the past year.\nThe Capital Markets segment generated record quarterly net revenues of $554 million and pre-tax income of $183 million, representing an impressive 33% pre-tax margin to net revenues.\nThese record results were driven by unprecedented investment banking revenues, strong tax credit fund revenues, and solid fixed income brokerage revenues.\nThe Asset Management segment produced record net revenues of $238 million and pre-tax income of $114 million, up 29% and 46% over the previous year, respectively.\nThese results were primarily due to growth in financial assets under management, driven by net inflows to fee-based accounts in the Private Client Group, partially offset by market depreciation and net outflows for Carillon Tower Advisers during the quarter.\nRaymond James Bank generated quarterly net revenues of $176 million and pre-tax income of $81 million.\nQuarterly net revenues increased 9% compared to the previous year, as higher earning asset levels offset year-over-year compression in the bank's net interest margin.\nSequentially, net revenues grew 4% due to higher asset balances during the quarter.\nThe year-over-year increase in pre-tax income was attributed to the previously mentioned revenue growth and reduced bank loan provision for credit losses in the current quarter.\nThe bank's pre-tax income decreased from the previous quarter primarily due to a reserve release in the prior quarter compared to a loan loss provision, mainly related to strong loan growth during the fourth fiscal quarter.\nIn fiscal year 2021, as shown on slide seven, we achieved record net revenues of $9.76 billion, a 22% increase from fiscal year 2020, and record net income of $1.4 billion, a 73% rise from fiscal 2020.\nAdjusted net income, excluding debt extinguishment losses and acquisition-related expenses during the year, was $1.49 billion, representing a 74% increase from adjusted net income in fiscal 2020.\nLet's examine the fiscal year results on slide eight.\nThe Private Client Group, Capital Markets, and Asset Management segments all achieved record net revenues and record pre-tax income, with all segments experiencing significant operating leverage during the fiscal year.\nThese results once again demonstrate the value of our diverse and complementary business lines.\nI'll start with consolidated revenues on slide 10.\nRecord quarterly net revenues of $2.7 billion increased 30% year-over-year and 9% sequentially.\nRecord asset management fees grew 8% sequentially, in line with the sequential increase in fee-based assets at the beginning of the quarter.\nPrivate Client Group assets in fee-based accounts increased 2% during the fourth fiscal quarter, providing a slight boost for this line item in the first quarter of fiscal 2022.\nConsolidated brokerage revenues of $541 million increased 9% compared to the previous year but decreased 2% from the preceding quarter.\nInstitutional fixed income brokerage revenues remained strong, although lower than the high levels of the comparison periods.\nPCG brokerage revenues rose 17% year-over-year but remained flat sequentially due to reduced trading volumes, which offset the benefit from higher asset balances and associated trailing commissions.\nBrokerage revenues for the fiscal year increased 13% to a record $2.2 billion, reflecting records for both PCG and fixed income, which had an exceptional year demonstrating their leading position in the depository segment.\nAccount and service fees of $170 million grew 21% year-over-year and 6% sequentially, mainly due to higher average mutual fund assets driving increased associated service fees.\nAs Paul has already discussed our record investment banking results this quarter, I'll focus on other revenues.\nOther revenues of $74 million increased 35% sequentially, primarily due to higher tax credit funds revenues.\nWe also recorded $18 million in private equity valuation gains during the quarter, of which approximately $5 million were attributable to non-controlling interest reflected in other expenses.\nMoving to slide 11.\nClients' domestic cash sweep balances, which are the main source of funding for our interest-earning assets and the balances with third-party banks that generate RJBDP fees, reached a record $66.7 billion at the end of the quarter, up 6% from the preceding quarter and representing 6.3% of domestic PCG client assets.\nAs we continued to experience growing cash balances and reduced demand from third-party banks during fiscal 2021, $10.8 billion of client cash is now held in the client interest program at the broker dealer.\nOver time, this cash could be redeployed to our bank or third-party banks as capacity becomes available, potentially earning a higher spread than we currently earn on short-term treasuries.\nOn slide 12, we saw an encouraging 8% sequential increase in the combined net interest income and BDP fees from third-party banks to $198 million.\nThis growth was largely due to strong asset growth and a resilient net interest margin at Raymond James Bank, which remained steady at 1.92% for the quarter.\nWe anticipate the bank's NIM to settle around 1.9% over the next couple of quarters.\nThe average yield on RJBDP balances with third-party banks remained unchanged at 29 basis points in the quarter.\nIf banks' demand for deposits doesn't improve from current levels, we expect downward pressure on this yield in fiscal 2022, especially in the latter half of the fiscal year, which is why we have been focusing on generating on-balance sheet growth in assets that could deliver good risk-adjusted returns.\nMoving to consolidated expenses on slide 13.\nStarting with our largest expense, compensation, the compensation ratio decreased sequentially from 67.2% to 65.8%, largely due to record revenues in the capital markets segment, which had a very low 52% compensation ratio during the quarter.\nGiven our current revenue mix and disciplined expense management, we are confident we can maintain a compensation ratio of 70% or lower in this near-zero short-term interest rate environment.\nAs we experienced in fiscal 2021, we can perform significantly better than 70% with Capital Markets revenues at or near these record levels, which is our expectation for at least the next quarter or two.\nNon-compensation expenses of $361 million decreased 15% sequentially, primarily due to the $98 million loss on extinguishment of debt in the fiscal third quarter.\nPartially offsetting this favorable variance, we had a modest provision for credit losses during the quarter, compared with a bank loan loss reserve release in the fiscal third quarter.\nOverall, our fiscal 2021 results demonstrate that we have remained focused on managing controllable expenses while continuing to invest in growth and maintaining high service levels for advisors and their clients.\nAlthough we haven't finalized our budget for fiscal 2022, we anticipate a significant rise in expenses due to various factors.\nWe plan to heavily invest in human resources and technology to maintain our exceptional growth and high-quality service standards for advisors and their clients.\nAs travel and conferences resume, we expect business development costs to increase, which our team is enthusiastic about.\nTo provide context, business development expenses reached approximately $200 million in fiscal 2019, prior to the pandemic.\nIn contrast to the $32 million net benefit for credit losses in fiscal 2021, we anticipate bank loan loss provisions related to net loan growth in fiscal 2022.\nThe pre-tax margin trend for the past five quarters is illustrated on Slide 14.\nThe fiscal fourth quarter of 2021 saw a pre-tax margin of 20.8%.\nThe adjusted pre-tax margin was 21.2%, boosted by record revenues and relatively low business development expenses.\nWe set a pre-tax margin target of 15% to 16% in the current near-zero interest rate environment during our Analyst and Investor Day in June.\nGiven the expected expense growth in fiscal 2022, we believe the upper end of this range is an appropriate target.\nHowever, as demonstrated this fiscal year, our margins can improve significantly when Capital Markets revenues are as robust as they were in fiscal 2021.\nSlide 15 shows that total assets reached approximately $61.9 billion at the quarter's end, an 8% sequential increase, reflecting strong loan growth at Raymond James Bank and a substantial rise in client cash balances on the balance sheet.\nOur liquidity and capital positions remain robust.\nWith a total capital ratio of 26.2% and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 12.6%, both more than double the regulatory requirements, we have considerable flexibility to grow the business opportunistically.\nRJF corporate cash at the parent company ended the quarter at $1.15 billion, a 26% decrease during the quarter, as we've set aside cash for the Charles Stanley acquisition, expected to close in the first or second quarter of fiscal 2022, pending regulatory approvals.\nSlide 16 outlines our capital actions over the past five quarters.\nWe repurchased nearly 1.5 million shares, adjusted for the split, for $118 million during the fiscal year.\nAs of October 27th, $632 million remained available under the current share repurchase authorization.\nDue to restrictions following our announced acquisition of TriState Capital Holdings, we don't expect to repurchase common shares until after closing.\nSlide 17 presents key credit metrics for Raymond James Bank.\nThe bank's loan portfolio maintains healthy credit quality, with most trends continuing to improve.\nCriticized loans decreased, and non-performing assets remain low at just 20 basis points.\nThe $5 million bank loan loss provision was primarily due to strong loan growth during the quarter.\nThe bank loan allowance for credit losses as a percentage of loans held for investment decreased from 1.34% to 1.27% at quarter-end.\nFor corporate portfolios, these allowances are higher at around 2.25%.\nI'm very satisfied with our exceptional results for this quarter and fiscal year, which surpassed many records.\nLooking ahead, we're well-positioned entering fiscal 2022 with strong capital ratios, quarter-end records for all key business metrics, and robust activity in financial advisor recruiting and investment banking.\nThe Private Client Group segment will benefit slightly from starting the fiscal first quarter with a 2% sequential increase in fee-based account assets.\nWe hope to maintain our current recruiting momentum, as our client-focused values and advanced technology platforms attract prospective advisors.\nIn the Capital Markets segment, we anticipate strong investment banking activity and solid fixed income brokerage results, driven by demand from depository clients.\nIf equity markets remain stable, the Asset Management segment should see positive results from higher financial assets under management.\nRaymond James Bank is expected to continue growing, as we have sufficient funding and capital to expand the balance sheet.\nWe'll maintain our focus on lending to PCG clients through securities-based loans and mortgages, while being selective in growing our corporate loan and agency-backed securities portfolio.\nOur long-term growth strategy remains centered on driving organic growth in core businesses, expanding technology investments, and pursuing strategic M&A opportunities.\nThe recent announcements to acquire TriState Capital and Charles Stanley Group demonstrate our commitment to these initiatives and to deploying excess capital over time.\nWe believe these acquisitions align with our long-standing criteria of cultural fit, strategic purpose, and shareholder value.\nThese outstanding results are a testament to the dedication of everyone in the Raymond James family.\nSummary: ",

read our disclaimers before handing over to Jay Farner.\nThis call aims to inform you about our performance in Q4 and full-year 2020, as well as our financial outlook.\nOur discussion will include non-GAAP financial measures.\nI will now pass the floor to Jay Farner to begin.\nThe outstanding outcomes we're about to discuss and the innovations behind them showcase your commitment during an exceptionally challenging year globally.\nYour efforts for our clients and communities exemplified the success of our beyond-profit mentality.\nThe platform remains crucial to our long-term success in our operating sectors and the record-breaking results we achieved in 2020.\nIn the coming minutes, you'll see how our decades-refined technology will continue driving success in current products, future extensions, and entirely new sectors.\nIf asked about our most crucial product, we would say it's the platform itself.\nAs I review our results, I'll provide updates on the Rocket Platform's key components: our technology, brand strength, Rocket Cloud Force, and data science foundation.\nI'll conclude by explaining how our platform enables growth and efficiency in existing business lines while launching and rapidly scaling new ventures.\nFor decades, we've aimed to simplify life's most complex and stressful transactions using technology.\nWe offer a straightforward digital process, exceptional client experience, and certainty for transactions like mortgages, real estate, auto sales, and various new initiatives we're developing.\nThis mission began in 1998 when our founder and Chairman, Dan Gilbert, committed all company resources to moving online in an email.\nHis vision was straightforward but far ahead of its time.\nMost Internet companies then focused on search, advertising, or basic e-commerce.\nDan envisioned something different.\nHe recognized the potential to use technology to make the most complex consumer transaction - buying and financing a home - accessible online nationwide.\nFor over 20 years, we've been quietly building our technology platform in Detroit to revolutionize how clients experience life's most significant events.\nWe continued enhancing our digital products and infrastructure in 2020, implementing nearly 4,500 product features and improving our platform every 28 minutes on average.\nOur strong national brand, trusted by consumers and partners, supports our platform.\nAs we expand, we continue investing and finding new ways to extend our reach and diversify our marketing channels, connecting with more clients.\nI'm confident most of you were among the nearly 100 million viewers who watched the Super Bowl recently.\nWe aired two 60-second ads emphasizing that \"certain\" is preferable when buying a home.\nOne commercial highlighted Rocket Mortgage and our technology that brings certainty to home buying, crucial in today's competitive real estate market.\nThe second showcased mortgage brokers' significant role in American homeownership.\nBrokers are key partners as we extend our platform's reach.\nThis unprecedented national exposure for brokers during a Super Bowl allows them to leverage the Rocket brand's power for local market differentiation.\nOur ads ranked first and second on USA Today's Ad Meter, widely considered the most prestigious consumer ranking of Super Bowl ads.\nThis means our ads not only reached millions of viewers but also gained tremendous visibility through social media, news articles, and free TV network replays.\nOverall, our Super Bowl campaign generated over 3.3 billion consumer impressions.\nOur areas of excellence and standard-setting attract some of the world's most respected organizations.\nWe've previously mentioned partnerships with American Express, State Farm, Intuit, Charles Schwab, and others.\nIn our last call, I hinted at a new partnership announcement.\nToday, I'm pleased to share that Morgan Stanley and E*TRADE have partnered with Rocket Mortgage to originate, close, and service conforming mortgages for their clients.\nThis arrangement allows Morgan Stanley to focus on jumbo lending while Rocket Mortgage provides conforming loan options to their millions of clients.\nWe're excited about this opportunity, which will launch this year.\nAnother core element of our business model is the impressive Rocket Cloud Force, now comprising over 6,600 U.S.-based professionals trained to advise clients on complex transactions.\nThe COVID pandemic demonstrated that our Rocket Cloud Force can operate effectively from anywhere, with team members working remotely across the country.\nThis team's versatility and expertise allow us to explore new verticals and services.\nOur ability to build, train, and license large-scale sales teams provides a significant competitive advantage.\nModern consumers expect simple, powerful digital experiences backed by trusted advisor support and consultation.\nThe Rocket Cloud Force's seamless integration into the online experience, providing timely, accurate, and actionable information, is a game-changer.\nIn markets where traditional experiences can be confusing and discouraging, such as buying or selling a home, car shopping, or considering a personal loan, our digital solutions and trusted advisors offer confidence and certainty.\nAlongside our powerful Rocket Cloud Force, our company continues rapidly expanding its use of ethical artificial intelligence and machine learning to streamline operations.\nWe benefit from millions of annual client interactions across various transactions, leveraging this information to create sophisticated models ensuring our brand is visible and top-of-mind when clients are ready to transact.\nSince early 2019, data science has driven over $75 billion in application volume.\nThe significance of data cannot be overstated.\nThis data enables us to swiftly innovate, predict market trends, and occasionally establish entirely new businesses.\nThese immediate insights provide a substantial competitive edge and consistently steer us towards optimal decisions with remarkable effectiveness.\nCollectively, these core components of our enterprise: our expandable system, our widely recognized brand, our Rocket Cloud workforce, and our tactical application of information, unite to form a technological powerhouse that continues to expand rapidly.\nIt required a quarter-century for our organization to finalize our initial million loans.\nIn the year 2020 alone, we've assisted over 1.1 million customers with their mortgage, vehicle, property, or personal financing requirements.\nInventiveness and implementation, coupled with a highly skilled Rocket Cloud team, generates a self-reinforcing cycle that continues to gain momentum rapidly.\nI'm even more enthusiastic about our future trajectory.\nMerely three years ago, we introduced Rocket Auto, believing we could utilize our platform and Rocket Cloud team to simplify the car buying process.\nIt's common knowledge that purchasing a vehicle is complex and daunting.\nIt's an experience most consumers don't eagerly anticipate, but we've managed to make it approachable and pleasant.\nBeginning from scratch in 2017, we've organically expanded Rocket Auto to surpass $750 million in gross merchandise value by 2020.\nHaving proven the concept, we plan to continue investing in accelerating growth in 2021 and beyond.\nOur network of partners is becoming an increasingly crucial driver of growth for Rocket Companies.\nWe are continuously evolving and diversifying from our initial direct-to-consumer business model.\nPartner volume constituted 38% of our completed loan volume in 2020, up from 23% just two years prior.\nWe view this evolution similarly to Amazon's past decision to open its marketplace to third-party vendors.\nLike Amazon, we've constructed a proprietary platform capable of processing millions of transactions annually.\nThe partner network brings expansion and diversification to our enterprise.\nTo support these efforts, we recently launched a directory of nearly every broker nationwide on rocketmortgage.com in late January.\nWe then promoted this directory through the Super Bowl advertisement I mentioned earlier.\nThe impact has been remarkable.\nIn less than a month since its launch, tens of thousands of consumers have visited the directory and clicked through to contact a broker.\nAll these elements combined have created an incredibly profitable company that has demonstrated the ability to grow, strengthen, and scale in any market conditions.\nThe fourth quarter of 2020 was no exception.\nAll our businesses exceeded expectations, contributing to a full-year adjusted revenue of $16.9 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $11.1 billion.\nAs a result of our exceptional financial performance, Rocket Companies has generated substantial capital.\nWe're excited to announce that we're sharing our success with our shareholders today.\nAs Julie will soon explain, our Board has authorized a special dividend of $1.11 per share for stockholders of record as of March 9, to be paid on March 23.\nWe're also accelerating our long-term approach of launching and scaling new businesses from the ground up.\nI'm pleased to announce the creation of Rocket Labs.\nRocket Labs' mission is to incubate new businesses within Rocket Companies that leverage our platform and provide our clients with services complementing our existing core products.\nOur approach empowers small, independent teams to work on big ideas and concepts, which form the core of our future products.\nWe are excited about Rocket Labs and the possibilities it represents.\nBefore I turn things over to Julie to share our financial results, I'll take a moment to give her a proper introduction.\nJulie and I have worked together within this company for 17 years.\nDuring that time, she has led the finance and accounting teams and done an exceptional job managing all aspects of our liquidity.\nJulie's foresight has helped us continue to grow in all market cycles.\nMoreover, there's nobody who knows the financial side of this industry better.\nWe're all fortunate to be working alongside her.\nWith that introduction, Julie, take it away.\nI'm pleased to again report strong financial results for Rocket Companies.\nFor the full year of 2020, Rocket Companies generated $16.9 billion of adjusted revenue and $11.1 billion of adjusted EBITDA as we concluded a record-setting year.\nIn discussing today's results, I'll walk through some key advantages of Rocket Companies' business model.\nSpecifically, I'll highlight the power of our platform to unlock scale, drive efficiency, and serve as a launchpad for new businesses focused on simplifying complicated transactions.\nI will also provide some insights on our capital allocation priorities.\nOur 2020 results demonstrate true growth at scale.\nFor the full year 2020, we generated $320 billion of closed loan volume, representing a 121% increase year over year.\nOur success in 2020 was broad-based, with consistent increases across both our direct-to-consumer and partner network channels.\nOur growth was balanced between new and existing client relationships.\n2020 was also a year of robust growth across Rocket Companies, with particular strength at Amrock, our title company, with revenues increasing 124% to $1.3 billion during the year.\nOur automotive retail marketplace, Rocket Auto, achieved impressive results by facilitating over $750 million in automotive e-commerce transactions.\nIn 2020, this amounted to slightly more than 32,000 vehicle sales, representing a growth of over 60% compared to the previous year.\nWe concluded 2020 on a particularly positive note, with fourth-quarter rate lock and closed loan volumes significantly surpassing our highest projections at $96 billion and $107 billion respectively.\nSeveral factors contributed to the exceptional performance in the fourth quarter.\nNotably, consumers are becoming increasingly at ease with completing complex, high-value transactions online.\nContinuing the trend observed throughout 2020, our automated, self-service digital platform was our fastest-growing channel in the fourth quarter.\nWe also experienced growth in Q4 from our branded partnerships and mortgage broker associates following the introduction of the Rocket Pro TPO brand to the broker community and the release of several improvements to our TPO software portal during the fourth quarter.\nRocket Homes also ended the year strongly, assisting clients with nearly $1.6 billion in real estate transactions during the fourth quarter alone.\nWhile current industry estimates of market size vary widely, it is evident that Rocket gained significant market share in 2020.\nOur full-year closed volume growth of 121% substantially exceeded any estimate of the overall industry's growth from third-party sources, which averaged 67%.\nOur Platform business model is crucial in enabling our unparalleled growth at scale.\nTo illustrate this, Rocket Mortgage's additional closed volume of $175 billion in 2020 was more than double the growth of any other market participant.\nIn fact, our incremental gain in 2020 alone was nearly large enough to surpass the entire closed loan volume of the nation's second-largest originator last year.\nAchieving this growth rate in a complex category like home loans requires a platform with extensive reach, scalable infrastructure, and centralized software-driven operations.\nThe Rocket platform is designed to perform and expand in the largest, most intricate markets.\nOur infrastructure also results in a highly efficient economic model with substantial operating leverage.\nOur 2020 results demonstrate Rocket's ability to increase scale from a single platform with minimal additional costs.\nFor the full year 2020, Rocket's adjusted revenue increased by $11 billion compared to the previous year.\nWe achieved this revenue growth while only adding $2 billion in expenses during the year, or $3 billion of annualized operating expenses based on our fourth quarter.\nTo showcase the efficiency of our business model, Rocket's transactions per production team member in 2020 were approximately triple the industry average.\nWhile our cost-effective platform model is driving record profitability, we're maintaining our long-term strategy of reinvesting in the business.\nKey areas for investment include our brand, product development, and initiatives to boost growth in the purchase market.\nWe continue to invest in talent acquisition, particularly in technical roles.\nFor example, our data science team now comprises over 300 professionals.\nWe're attracting high-performing individuals across multiple teams, including the ongoing expansion of our technology and product strategy departments.\nOur brand is another crucial investment priority, including our recent Super Bowl advertisements, which generated significant brand recognition and drove record traffic to our online and mobile platforms.\nAmong our key product development priorities is Rocket Logic, the next generation of our core workflow management platform.\nThis new platform guides users through the most effective next action, resulting in faster, more accurate workflows.\nWe are very pleased with our initial pilot, where we are observing a 20% improvement in processing times within the test group.\nEven more exciting is that Rocket Logic can be applied to enhance processes beyond mortgage origination.\nWe anticipate that Rocket Logic and our numerous automation initiatives will drive continued efficiency in our business model.\nThe core of our economic flywheel is our constant leveraging of profitability advantages to reinvest in the business, further strengthening our competitive position.\nAnother key advantage of the Rocket Companies' platform is our ability to test, launch, and rapidly scale new business models.\nThis entrepreneurial approach is evident in our scaled mortgage operations.\nIn two years, our partner network has grown from less than $20 billion in closed loan volume to $120 billion annually.\nWe see similar potential within our early-stage, rapidly expanding businesses such as Rocket Auto, Rocket Loans, and Rocket Homes.\nTo that end, as Jay announced earlier, the launch of Rocket Labs will further accelerate our focus on expanding the business in ways that leverage our platform and serve our client base.\nWe believe our clients will greatly benefit from these additional business lines over time.\nRegarding our first-quarter outlook, we expect closed loan volume of $98 billion to $103 billion compared to $51.7 billion in the first quarter of 2020.\nWe anticipate net rate lock volume of $88 billion to $95 billion, up from $56 billion in the first quarter of 2020.\nWe project gain-on-sale margins of 3.6% to 3.9% compared to 3.25% in the first quarter of 2020.\nWe're enthusiastic about the continued strength and momentum of the Rocket platform.\nWe concluded 2020 with a very strong balance sheet, including $2 billion in cash and $7.7 billion in total liquidity.\nTotal liquidity includes cash on hand, undrawn lines of credit, undrawn MSR lines, and corporate cash used to self-fund loan originations, which could be transferred to funding facilities at our discretion.\nAs we stated at the time of our IPO last summer, our capital allocation priorities always begin with properly capitalizing and reinvesting in the business.\nAs I mentioned earlier, we are actively deploying capital with investments in our platform, brand, and talent.\nWe also aim to deploy capital through add-on acquisitions that would enhance our economic flywheel and bring value to our client base.\nOur next priority is to return capital to shareholders through dividends, opportunistic share buybacks, or a combination of both.\nGiven our record level of profitability in 2020, the Board approved a special dividend of $1.11 per Class A common share, funded by an equity distribution of $2.2 billion.\nOur substantial cash generation provides us significant flexibility to drive long-term value for our shareholders.\nAdditionally, we remain authorized to repurchase up to $1 billion of Rocket Companies' common stock.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Those who listen to any replay should be aware that the accuracy of statements made may decrease over time.\nI trust you and your loved ones are in good health.\nThe events of 2020 will remain etched in our memories for a long time to come.\nCOVID-19 has caused unparalleled disruptions to both public health and the economy.\nCombined with the social and political turbulence our nation has undergone, 2020 will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the most challenging and significant years in our lives.\nWhile an open-air shopping center REIT faces relatively minor issues compared to the broader challenges of 2020, I take pride in RPT's response and performance during this past year.\nRPT demonstrated its dedication to our mission of transforming commercial spaces into community hubs through our tenant support program, charitable contributions, property-level safety measures, and curbside pickup initiatives.\nWe also acted quickly and decisively to secure our liquidity and maintain access to capital by obtaining our first investment-grade credit rating from Fitch.\nFurthermore, I was greatly impressed by the team's relentless efforts in pursuing rent collections, which rose to 91% in the fourth quarter.\nAfter repaying the remaining $100 million balance on our revolver, we now have over $100 million in cash and a fully available $350 million revolver, positioning us to fully leverage our unique and valuable partnership with GIC and opportunistically execute our external growth plans.\nWe continue to monitor a robust pipeline of potential acquisitions and have observed some recent increase in activity.\nI want to emphasize that the underlying real estate remains the primary focus of our acquisition strategy.\nWe then seek opportunities for growth, which can manifest in various forms such as below-market rents, mismanaged assets, or redevelopment potential.\nThis growth can occur across different retail formats, including grocery-anchored centers, lifestyle centers, power centers, and community centers.\nAs previously disclosed, we had five deals in our GIC venture that were either signed or in negotiations in February 2020.\nWhen the pandemic struck, we and our partners decided to withdraw from all of these deals.\nWe are now fortunate to have the necessary liquidity and a comprehensive pipeline within our core markets, and we believe the growing value disparity between property types, tenant categories, and markets is creating unique opportunities that we aim to capitalize on in 2021.\nOne of our strengths is anticipating future trends rather than focusing on past developments.\nLast year, we entered the Austin market through our off-market acquisition of Lakehills Plaza.\nSince our purchase, Tesla announced plans for a new $1.1 billion assembly plant.\nCompanies like Google, Oracle, and Digital Realty have each announced plans to relocate or expand in Austin.\nAdditionally, Barshop & Oles revealed plans for a new $1 billion mixed-use development directly across the highway from our property.\nJust over a year has passed since our acquisition, and we are more convinced than ever about the potential of this dynamic market that truly represents future opportunities.\nWe are making good progress in our grocery negotiations and are also discussing deals with various tenant types such as home improvement, wholesale clubs, discount stores, fast food restaurants, and medical facilities.\nThis quarter, we signed leases for 120,000 square feet, which is a 10% increase compared to the same period last year.\nNoteworthy lease signings this quarter included two new agreements with a modern, technologically advanced healthcare provider.\nThese agreements demonstrate our increased emphasis on health and wellness tenants.\nWe are also seeing promising activity for the two Stein Mart locations we reclaimed this quarter, presenting an opportunity to significantly upgrade the quality of tenants in both spaces.\nWith an average base rent of less than $11.50 per square foot, we anticipate a substantial increase in rental income when these spaces are re-leased.\nOne of the Stein Mart locations is already under lease, while the other has multiple letters of intent being negotiated with well-known national brands.\nAt the end of the fourth quarter, we had a backlog of signed but not yet operational leases worth $3.2 million, an increase from $3 million in the previous quarter.\nWe are currently in negotiations for leases worth approximately $2 million in annual base rent, up from about $1.5 million last quarter, providing us some insight into potential offsets for future tenant losses.\nThe pipeline for new leases is strong, and we are optimistic about its positive impact on our future cash flows.\nFurthermore, we are pursuing several redevelopment opportunities that are detailed in our supplementary materials.\nThese 11 projects involve redesigning, expanding, or combining spaces, similar to the 18 targeted redevelopment projects we completed in 2019.\nWe expect to achieve attractive returns on our investment for these new projects, ranging from high single to low double-digit percentages, as we did with the previous projects.\nDespite the increase in reported COVID cases at the end of the year, our suburban portfolio was less affected by additional lockdown measures implemented since the summer.\n94% of our portfolio, measured by annual base rent, remains open, unchanged from the previous quarter, with 4% of our closures related to our movie theaters.\nThe reopening of our theaters remains uncertain.\nOur exposure is almost entirely tied to Regal, whose parent company, Cineworld, recently secured additional financing that they expect will provide liquidity through 2021 and beyond, which is a positive development for this tenant.\nWhile we continue to prioritize our most cost-effective source of capital, retained cash flows, we recognize the importance of dividends as a component of total shareholder returns.\nWith this in mind, we have set a common dividend of $0.075 per share for the first quarter of 2021.\nThis quarterly rate reflects a careful analysis of our expected taxable income and liquidity requirements.\nWe believe the new dividend rate is sustainable and has the potential for growth in line with earnings, while allowing us to preserve cash to support our growth initiatives and providing sufficient buffer to weather periodic future economic downturns.\nToday, I will discuss our fourth quarter performance, our robust balance sheet and liquidity position, and conclude with insights to help everyone understand our expectations for how our business will trend in 2021.\nIn the fourth quarter, our bad debt and rent abatements totaled $4.4 million, approximately the same as the third quarter.\nWe set aside reserves for about 89% of our uncollected fourth quarter recurring billings, limiting potential further downsides from these categories compared to our fourth quarter run rate.\nAs of year-end, $18.1 million of recurring billings for the period from April through December 2020 remain unpaid, of which $11.9 million have been reserved.\nThe majority of the unclaimed $6.2 million is anticipated to be reimbursed during 2021 and 2022.\nWe remain highly satisfied with our portfolio's resilience and minimal bankruptcy exposure, as our leased rate of 92.8% remained stable in the quarter, decreasing only 50 basis points sequentially, mainly due to reclaiming our two Stein Mart leases mentioned previously.\nThe quarter's combined rent spreads stayed positive at 3.4%, affected by a few strategic renewals with no increase.\nIt's crucial to recognize that the releasing spread is just one element of the organic growth profile.\nAnother crucial factor we consider in lease negotiations is the yearly contractual rent increases.\nThe leases we executed during the quarter had annual contractual rent increases of approximately 150 basis points, which significantly contributes to establishing a sustainable long-term NOI growth profile.\nAs we've consistently mentioned, we anticipate some fluctuation in our quarterly statistics given our portfolio's size, but we see an ongoing opportunity to adjust to market rates as we renew older leases over the coming years.\nAs Brian mentioned regarding dividend policy, we've prioritized free cash flow, enabling us to use our most cost-effective form of capital to capitalize on these opportunities as we restore our portfolio to pre-COVID leased rate levels of nearly 95%.\nWe were delighted to receive our first investment-grade credit rating from Fitch, underscoring our balance sheet's strength and adaptability.\nGiven this recognition and increased confidence in our business and access to low-cost debt capital, we no longer saw the need to maintain a large cash reserve and paid off the remaining $100 million balance on our revolving credit facility last week.\nWe will continue to explore our portfolio for additional capital-raising opportunities to further strengthen our liquidity position and support our external growth plans.\nWe concluded the fourth quarter with a trailing 12-month net debt to pro forma adjusted EBITDA ratio of 7.4 times, slightly up from 7.2 times in the previous quarter as another COVID-impacted quarter was included in the calculation.\nWe remain dedicated to bringing our leverage into our long-term target range of 5.5 to 6.5 times and expect to see steady improvement in EBITDA as we return to more normal reserve levels and as our signed leasing backlog starts to take effect throughout 2021.\nWe are setting our 2021 operating FFO per share guidance at $0.77 to $0.87, which represents an expected improvement over the annualized 2020 fourth quarter operating FFO per share of $0.72.\nKey factors contributing to this are a positive impact of $0.03 from interest expense, mainly due to repaying our revolving credit line, and $0.02 from our signed but not yet open backlog, which we expect the majority to open evenly throughout 2021.\nAdditional upside potential depends on favorable bad debt reserves, which we anticipate will be significantly influenced by the reopening of our theaters, which is contingent on the progress of vaccine distribution and movie production.\nWhile we assume these circumstances will improve over the course of 2021, we felt it appropriate to establish a wider range given the potential varying outcomes for our theater exposure, which accounts for about $0.10 per share of earnings.\nIf our theaters remain closed and fail to pay their contractual rent, our operating FFO could be at the lower end of the range.\nConversely, if they are open and paying, we should be near the upper end, all other factors being equal.\nIt's important to note that our guidance doesn't include the net impact of changes to 2020 estimates for bad debt and straight-line rent reserves.\nAdditionally, while acquisitions are not factored into our guidance range, we plan to reinvest $100 million of cash from our balance sheet into opportunistic acquisitions that meet our strict underwriting criteria, representing potential upside to our range.\nAlthough the short-term COVID trajectory remains uncertain, we are cautiously optimistic that the worst is now behind us.\nAs we approach a more normal environment and given the conflicting effects of permanent move-outs and rent collection statistics, we hope to refocus on more traditional measures of REIT operating performance such as occupancy, rent spreads, and same-property NOI growth.\nAs part of our ongoing efforts to enhance our disclosures, we've added a net asset value page to our supplemental on page 14 this quarter to assist in your analysis of our real estate value.\nSummary: ",

efficiently, and positioning to return capital to shareholders as Appalachia's most efficient natural gas and NGL producer.\nI'll briefly discuss each of these before handing it over to Dennis and Mark for more details.\nLet's start with unit costs and margin improvements.\nRange's Q1 unit costs were on track and better than expected, with G&A, LOE, exploration expense, and production taxes at the low end of guidance.\nWe also reported a significant gain in marketing activities for the quarter.\nAs anticipated, GP&T increased from last quarter but was more than offset by major improvements in NGL and natural gas realizations, greatly enhancing Range's margins.\nRange's unhedged realized price for Q1 was about $3.20 per mcfe, $0.51 above the NYMEX Henry Hub equivalent of $2.69.\nThis premium stems from our diverse marketing portfolio and liquids production.\nThe liquids uplift boosts margins and lowers Range's breakeven costs compared to dry gas production alone.\nRange's pre-hedge margin improved by over $1 per mcfe in Q1 versus the 2020 average.\nWith improved fundamentals for natural gas liquids and about 65% of our activity in liquids-rich areas this year, Range is well-positioned to continue benefiting from this trend.\nIn Q1, Range also capitalized on better daily natural gas prices, achieving a differential $0.08 better than guidance midpoint, only partially offset by higher transport fuel costs, further improving margins and cash flow.\nWith this improved pricing, Range generated $193 million in operating cash flow before working capital changes, and with $105 million in capital spending, produced solid free cash flow.\nAs shown on slide 14, we expect this trend to continue with significant EBITDAX growth this year compared to last.\nCombined with absolute debt reduction, this organic free cash flow generation advances us toward our long-term balance sheet goals.\nThe Q1 all-in capital investment of $105 million demonstrates excellent operational execution.\nWe continue finding ways to reduce costs, leveraging our large contiguous acreage to complete our operational plan with industry-leading capital efficiency.\nAfter coming in under budget for the past three years, Range is on track to do so again in 2021.\nThe operations team safely executed this capital-efficient plan while keeping our long-term environmental objectives in mind.\nRange ended 2020 with leading emissions intensity, reducing greenhouse gas emissions intensity and progressing toward our 2025 net-zero goal.\nThis goal begins with efficient operations that minimize our footprint while generating competitive returns.\nWe believe Range's industry-leading capital efficiency and maintenance capital are key differentiators.\nAs discussed before, Range's large contiguous acreage provides operational and financial efficiencies in areas like water recycling, infrastructure, rig mobility, and well optimization.\nDennis will illustrate how these combined benefits improve Range's ongoing development and corporate returns while bolstering our environmental efforts.\nOur low well costs, strong recoveries, and shallow base decline under 20% result in high capital efficiency, providing a solid foundation for sustainable free cash flow.\nRange's ability to maintain this efficiency long-term due to our multi-decade core inventory further sets us apart.\nFor context, Range is bringing about 60 wells online this year, but we have roughly 2,000 Marcellus locations with EURs exceeding 2 Bcfe per 1,000 feet of lateral.\nThe average recovery of these wells is very similar to those Range has brought online in recent years, giving us an unmatched decades-long runway of high-quality wells.\nThis isn't true for many peers, which we believe positions Range as well as any upstream company to benefit from improving commodity prices in the medium and long term.\nBefore handing over to Dennis and Mark, I'll reaffirm Range's commitment to sustainable free cash flow.\nWe believe Range will distinguish itself among peers due to our low sustaining capital, competitive cost structure, marketing strategies, and crucially, our multi-decade core inventory, which will become an increasing advantage as other operators deplete their core inventories.\nWe'll maintain our focus on safe, efficient, and environmentally sound operations, prudent capital allocation, and generating sustainable shareholder returns.\nThese priorities are reflected in our updated compensation metrics in our latest proxy statement.\nOver to you, Dennis.\nWhen we outlined our 2021 operational plans, we focused on improving operational and capital efficiencies, enhancing margins, and further improving our environmental and safety performance.\nLooking at Q1 results, our operating teams are off to a strong start in meeting our yearly objectives, with production exceeding guidance and capital spending aligning with our 2021 plan.\nQ1 capital spending was $105 million, about 25% of our 2021 program budget.\nAs discussed previously, our capital spending is front-loaded this year, consistent with past years.\nWe expect Q2 capital spending to be roughly one-third of the annual budget, mainly due to completion and turn-in-line activity timing shifting to Q2.\nReduced capital investments in H2 2021 align with our activity slowing to one drilling rig and one frac crew during Q3 and Q4.\nOur Q1 production of 2.08 Bcf equivalent per day resulted from recent strong well performance and exceptional field run time, largely due to our production operations team's near-perfect winter operations planning and execution.\nQ1 production included bringing 16 wells online across our dry, wet, and super-rich acreage.\nThese Q1 turn-in-lines averaged over 11,500 feet in horizontal length, adding nearly 200,000 producing lateral feet to Range's Appalachia assets.\nFrom Q4 2020 through Q1 2021, our activity shifted toward wells in our processable gas areas.\nThese turn-in-lines increased Range's average oil production to over 8,000 barrels per day in Q1 and boosted overall liquids production to levels seen in H1 2020.\nWe expect this wet production contribution to continue through year-end, with Q2 production projected at about 2.1 Bcfe per day.\nThis positions us to achieve our 2021 maintenance target of 2.15 Bcfe per day with additional margin-enhancing liquids production while spending $425 million or less.\nTurning to operational highlights, we drilled 15 wells across our dry, wet, and super-rich areas in Q1.\nFour of these rank in the top 20 lateral lengths in Range's Marcellus program history, all exceeding 17,800 feet.\nDrilling efficiencies continued, with nearly 75% of new wells drilled on existing production pads, along with a 5% increase in daily lateral footage drilled compared to 2020.\nOn the completion side, 16 wells were completed during the quarter.\nThe team completed approximately 1,200 frac stages and set a new efficiency record for first quarter winter operations, averaging over eight stages daily.\nThis performance surpassed Range's previous best first quarter winter operations record by 14%.\nThe water operations team achieved a first quarter record by using nearly 2 million barrels of third-party produced water, resulting in cost savings of over $4.5 million for completions.\nDespite challenging winter weather conditions, the team achieved some of our best operational results to date.\nSafety and environmental performance remained top priorities throughout these operations.\nFirst quarter lease operating expense was comparable to the previous year's Appalachia level, remaining low at $0.09 per Mcfe.\nThis low LOE was largely due to a well-planned proactive winter operations strategy aimed at minimizing weather-related production impacts and associated costs.\nThese efforts resulted in a field runtime exceeding 99% with weather-related production impact of less than 0.5 million cubic feet per day for the quarter, which is an impressive accomplishment.\nThe operational successes and milestones in the first quarter were achieved through a focused, continuous improvement approach centered on four key areas.\nThe four key areas driving operational and capital efficiency, as well as environmental objectives, are Range's water recycling program, long lateral development, utilization of existing infrastructure, and optimized use of drilling and completions equipment.\nThese strategies provide benefits such as reduced operating costs, improved efficiency, minimized environmental impact, and lower emissions.\nI will now explain how these four strategies are implemented by our operations and support teams, along with their positive impacts, using three wells turned to sales in the first quarter as an example.\nThese three wells were drilled on an existing surface location with producing wells that were initially developed and brought online in 2013.\nThe original wells had an average lateral length of just over 3,000 feet per well.\nIn comparison, the new wells have an average lateral length of nearly 16,000 feet per well, which is more than 5 times longer.\nNo additional land disturbance was required for developing 5 times the acreage, and no new production, gathering, or processing infrastructure was needed for these new wells.\nRange has close to 250 developed pads in Southwest PA, and we have returned to 84 of these locations to drill additional wells.\nWe plan to drill more wells on these same pad sites and on approximately two-thirds of Range's pads that we haven't yet revisited for additional activity.\nWe have only begun to tap into this opportunity.\nThe three new wells were completed late last year using our contracted electric fracturing fleet, which replaced 470,000 gallons of diesel fuel.\nThis resulted in cost savings of about $300,000 per well and significantly reduced associated emissions.\n40% of the water used to complete these new wells was recycled from Range's producing wells and third-party sources obtained through our water sharing process.\nThe remaining water was pumped from our water pipeline network, installed nearly a decade ago, further reducing emissions by eliminating more than 13,400 truck trips.\nThe average initial production of these wells exceeded 44 million cubic feet equivalent per day, including more than 9,700 barrels per day of combined condensate and natural gas liquids per well, ranking them among the top wells in our Marcellus program history.\nThis is just one of many examples we could share from our development in recent years with similar results.\nThese efforts have underpinned our operational efficiency gains and give us confidence in maintaining our drilling and completion costs below $600 per foot, while achieving our environmental goals and producing top-tier wells.\nThese benefits highlight the value of having a high-quality contiguous acreage position and a forward-thinking technical team.\nRegarding Range's environmental and safety performance, we transitioned to a quarterly leak detection program in 2020, doubling the number of inspections conducted.\nThis increased inspection frequency resulted in an additional 7,400 metric tons of CO2 equivalent emissions being removed from our program, leading to a 67% reduction for related components.\nThis effort, along with advancements in production facility design and the use of an electric frac fleet, has further reduced Range's reported emissions to a new low CO2 equivalent level.\nOur emissions performance is competitive with any natural gas play in North America and puts Range in an enviable position globally.\nRange's safety performance also improved, with a 30% reduction in recordable incidents for the quarter, the best Q1 performance in the past five years.\nRegarding marketing, Range's NGL and condensate business benefited from a strong first quarter.\nMarket prices improved across the board, and our advantaged portfolio of contracts allowed Range to capture premium pricing and achieve the highest pre-hedge NGL realization since late 2018.\nThe primary driver for improved pricing in NGLs and condensate was strong demand in a market with decreased supply.\nPreliminary results show that Q1 2021 domestic demand for US propane and butane (LPG) was 13% higher year-on-year, while supply decreased by 4%.\nCondensate supply in the Northeast is estimated to have decreased by 15% to 20% year-on-year.\nDue to these improved fundamentals, the market average NGL barrel price increased significantly during the quarter.\nRange's Mont Belvieu equivalent barrel price of $24.83 was 38% higher than the previous quarter and 83% higher compared to the first quarter of 2020.\nPropane prices led the increase, rising nearly 60% versus the prior quarter and 140% versus Q1 of 2020.\nRange's premium to a Mont Belvieu equivalent barrel increased by approximately $1.50 per barrel compared to the previous quarter, reaching the highest premium to Mont Belvieu in the company's history.\nLooking ahead, we anticipate propane and butane market prices will continue to show strong year-on-year gains as storage balances for these NGLs are much tighter compared to last year.\nThis past winter saw the largest seasonal withdrawal of propane in over a decade, leaving end-of-March propane stocks at a 33% deficit compared to last year and a 17% deficit to the five-year average.\nGiven the strong international demand due to new chemical capacity coming online and recovering global economies, we believe it will be challenging to replenish US propane stocks to a comfortable level by fall.\nAs a result, we expect propane prices to trade at levels at or above 60% of WTI crude this fall and the upcoming winter.\nOn the commercial side, Range entered into new and diverse LPG export-related contracts starting April 1st.\nThese contracts will increase flexibility, reduce costs, and further enhance realized propane and butane prices, continuing Range's momentum in achieving strong price premiums relative to the market.\nWe are also optimizing Range's condensate sales portfolio by adding flexibility, improving margins, and ensuring product placement.\nAs this year progresses and optimization continues through a diverse set of counterparties, we expect our condensate differentials to WTI will continue to improve, further benefiting our liquids area development plan discussed earlier.\nRegarding natural gas, cold weather during mid-Q1 resulted in the third coldest February in the past 10 years.\nDespite milder weather in January and March, the first quarter's gas-weighted heating degree days ended slightly above the five-year average.\nOur diverse transportation portfolio resulted in a Q1 differential of $0.14 under NYMEX, including basis hedging.\nWe anticipate potential improvements in natural gas pricing due to operators targeting maintenance production levels and year-over-year storage improvements, suggesting an undersupplied market.\nRange is on track with its differential guidance of $0.30 to $0.40 for the year, given the positive outlook for natural gas.\nOur first quarter results demonstrate a strong start to the year, with improved operational and capital efficiency while meeting environmental and safety goals.\nRange's core strategy is to consistently deliver on stated objectives.\nThe team successfully executed efficient operations, maintained production levels, conducted drilling and completions activities within budget, and implemented margin-enhancing expense management, resulting in significant free cash flow.\nWe aim to replicate this performance every quarter.\nThe first quarter's results showcase the advantages of dependable operations, productive wells, and diverse sales points for natural gas, natural gas liquids, and condensate.\nOperating cash flow before working capital adjustments was $193 million, compared to $105 million in capital expenditures.\nFree cash flow improved significantly compared to previous periods, driven by a 50% increase in pre-hedge realized prices per unit of production, reaching $3.20 per mcfe in Q1.\nThe realized price per unit exceeded NYMEX Henry Hub by $0.51, due to improved natural gas basis and a 77% increase in NGL price per barrel, which reached $26.35 pre-hedge.\nNGL and condensate realizations equate to $4.39 and $8.17 per mcfe respectively, contributing to the premium over Henry Hub.\nRange's NGL prices surpassed Mont Belvieu NGL barrel by $1.52, thanks to our unique portfolio of domestic and international sales contracts.\nRange consistently focuses on reducing unit costs to enhance margins.\nOperating expenses decreased by over 40% year-over-year to $0.09 per unit, due to efficient Marcellus operations and the sale of higher-cost assets.\nCash G&A expenses fell to $28 million or $0.15 per unit in Q1, primarily due to lower compensation costs and targeted spending on essential areas.\nCash interest expense was approximately $55 million, reflecting recent refinancing activities that improved the company's debt maturity profile and liquidity.\nGathering, processing, and transportation expenses increased, but this is a positive result of higher NGL prices leading to improved NGL margins.\nRange's processing costs are based on a percentage of NGL revenues, so higher NGL prices result in higher processing costs but also greater overall margins.\nDue to rising NGL prices, GP&T expenses for 2021 are trending towards the high end of guidance, but this is more than offset by expected higher NGL revenue at current pricing.\nRange has successfully managed its debt profile, reducing bond maturities through 2024 by almost $1.2 billion while improving liquidity to nearly $2 billion.\nIn Q1, we issued $600 million in new bonds due 2029, which, combined with the reaffirmation of our facilities, provides substantial liquidity and demonstrates our asset value.\nWe expect to use cash flows to retire upcoming debt maturities, supported by ample liquidity.\nIn Q1, we redeemed $63 million in near-term senior and senior subordinated notes.\nThe debt markets have improved significantly, as evidenced by the trading levels of Range's bonds, indicating better access to and cost of capital.\nFuture debt retirement will primarily be funded by organic free cash flow.\nWe will manage debt retirement cost-effectively while considering potential refinancing risks.\nWe may opportunistically redeem bonds if early redemption options become economically viable on a risk-adjusted basis.\nRecent liability management has temporarily increased interest expenses but avoided more costly forms of capital that would have diluted shareholder ownership.\nImproving our balance sheet remains a key objective, with leverage metrics incorporated into long-term compensation criteria targeting a debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.5 times or better.\nOur focus is on creating shareholder value through free cash flow generation and prudent redeployment.\nAt current commodity prices, we expect to approach our target leverage levels by the end of 2022.\nRegarding hedging, we follow a glide path to add positions throughout the year.\nWe intentionally moved at a deliberate pace in 2020 when adding 2021 hedge positions and plan to follow similar principles this year for 2022 and beyond.\nOur goal is to balance prudent cash flow risk management while avoiding hedging away improved supply-demand balance in backward-dated price curves.\nOur strategic actions over the past three years have focused on reducing risk while maintaining and enhancing the intrinsic value of our asset base.\nWe believe Range possesses the largest portfolio of quality inventory in Appalachia, and our actions have preserved and enhanced per-share exposure to that inventory.\nWe've made significant progress in positioning Range as a more resilient business, as evidenced by our first quarter results, which demonstrate our readiness to capitalize on improved market dynamics.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Despite global challenges in 2020, we are proud of our team's strong performance across all areas of our company, demonstrating the resilience of Reliance's business model.\nI commend everyone for swiftly adapting to changing circumstances, prioritizing customer care, and maintaining an unwavering focus on health and safety, our top core value.\nSince 2017, we have been working to integrate our safety culture throughout our entire organization through our SMART Safety initiative.\nIn 2020, we united as one company to address the unique challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic with unprecedented focus.\nWe not only implemented new protocols to combat virus spread but also improved our overall safety performance, reducing our incident rate by about 23% compared to 2019.\nAlthough this is a significant achievement, we will continue striving until we reach our goal of zero incidents.\nI'd like to recognize Karla Lewis and Arthur Ajemyan for their recent well-deserved promotions.\nAs part of our Board's executive succession plan, Karla was elevated from CFO to President and appointed to our Board of Directors on January 15.\nSince joining Reliance in 1992, Karla has consistently displayed excellent leadership and judgment, earning respect from employees and shareholders alike.\nKarla's promotion acknowledges her valuable contributions to Reliance.\nThis new role will allow her to expand her knowledge of our field operations and diversify her experience.\nArthur Ajemyan was also promoted to Vice President and Chief Financial Officer on January 15.\nArthur has excelled in various roles within Reliance's finance and accounting department for over 15 years.\nI extend my congratulations to both Karla and Arthur on their new positions and look forward to our continued collaboration in their new capacities.\nLet's now review our 2020 performance.\nWe achieved solid financial results in 2020, driven by consistently strong operational execution despite significant market volatility.\nOur performance highlights the strength and resilience of our people and unique business model, as well as our ability to succeed in both favorable and challenging conditions due to our diverse products, markets, and geographical presence.\nOur decentralized structure enabled us to quickly adapt to changing market conditions and demand trends.\nThese factors, combined with pricing discipline and ongoing improvements in our value-added processing capabilities, allowed us to achieve record annual gross profit margins for the second consecutive year at 31.5%, a 120 basis point increase from 2019 and surpassing our estimated sustainable range of 28% to 30%.\nWe maintained healthy profitability levels despite extremely volatile and challenging market conditions.\nFor the full year, we generated non-GAAP earnings per share of $7.71, resulting from strong margin discipline and effective expense management, which helped mitigate our decline in profitability.\nFollowing a record year in 2019, we maintained robust cash flow from operations of $1.17 billion in 2020, driven by our profitability and focus on working capital management.\nWe achieved our company-wide inventory turn goal of 4.7 times based on tons for 2020, thanks to our ongoing efforts to align inventory with current demand levels and our unique advantage of cross-selling inventory among our family of companies.\nConsistent with historical trends and our business model's foundation, we source a significant portion of our metal from domestic suppliers.\nIt is crucial that we continue to support our mill partners, who have consistently stood by Reliance during challenging times.\nOur countercyclical cash flow generation allows us to remain flexible and opportunistic in pursuing growth initiatives while simultaneously returning value to our stockholders.\nWe invested $172 million in capital expenditures in 2020, including various growth opportunities such as our recent toll processing expansion in Texas and Kentucky.\nWe are introducing our 2021 capital expenditure budget of $245 million, which includes new buildings and projects to expand, upgrade, and maintain many of our operating facilities.\nWe are installing energy-efficient lighting and solar panels in certain facilities.\nOur 2021 budget also includes innovative processing equipment to provide customers with top-quality products and services.\nAlthough COVID-19 has slowed acquisition activity overall, we continue to see a healthy pipeline of potential candidates as we broaden our view on prospective growth opportunities.\nWe evaluate opportunities based on strict criteria to ensure a strong fit within our family of companies.\nRegarding stockholder returns, we repurchased $337.3 million worth of common stock at an average cost of $91.80 per share and paid $164.1 million in dividends to shareholders in 2020.\nWe have maintained regular quarterly dividend payments for 61 consecutive years without suspension or reduction.\nWe have increased our dividend 28 times since our 1994 IPO, including the most recent 10% increase for the first quarter of 2021.\nLooking ahead to the remainder of 2021, Reliance will continue to execute and refine our proven model that has led to industry-leading results for many decades.\nDuring the past 12 months, we've streamlined our operations to be more efficient while maintaining our competitive advantage and the key aspects of our business that make Reliance a dependable partner.\nWe'll continue to prioritize enhancing our products, expanding into new markets and regions, while maintaining strict pricing policies, careful cost management, strategic inventory control, organic expansion, and innovation.\nThroughout the previous year, it became clear that our clients depend on us to provide increased support during challenging times, often requiring more frequent and substantial assistance.\nI frequently state, and will reiterate, that America will need to rely on Reliance for its rebuilding efforts.\nAs a crucial business, we were able to continue operations throughout the COVID-19 crisis, with our 2020 sales volume decreasing by only 10.8% compared to the previous year.\nOur average selling price dropped by 9.6% in 2020 compared to 2019, due to declining factory prices for most of our products during the first three quarters of the year.\nDespite these negative factors, we achieved a record-high gross profit margin in 2020.\nIn the final quarter of 2020, strong demand in most of our target markets resulted in our sales volume declining by only 1.3% compared to the previous quarter.\nThis was the smallest fourth-quarter seasonal decline we've seen in a decade and significantly exceeded our projections.\nDespite typical holiday-related customer closures and fewer shipping days in the fourth quarter, we experienced robust demand throughout the period as economic recovery gained momentum.\nDriven by solid demand and increasing input costs, metal prices improved as factory price increases for many of our products accelerated throughout the fourth quarter, with some carbon steel products nearly doubling in price, leading to a 4.6% increase in our average selling price compared to the third quarter of 2020, surpassing our expectations.\nThe favorable demand and pricing conditions in the fourth quarter contributed to our record gross profit margin of 33%, a 60 basis point improvement from the third quarter of 2020.\nOn a non-GAAP FIFO basis, which we believe best reflects our daily operating performance, our gross profit margin of 33.6% increased by 180 basis points from 31.8% in the third quarter of 2020.\nOur record gross profit margin demonstrates the exceptional performance of our field managers who effectively implemented price increases when mills announced them, before receiving higher-cost inventory, pushing our gross profit margin above already strong levels resulting from our focus on higher-margin orders.\nWhile we are very pleased with our record fourth quarter and full-year gross profit margin, we still believe our estimated sustainable gross profit margin range of 28% to 30% is appropriate as we navigate the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and operate in this uncertain environment.\nNonetheless, maintaining our strong gross profit margin remains a fundamental aspect of our business model.\nWe are confident that our managers will continue to capitalize on the significant investments we've made to expand and improve our value-added processing capabilities.\nIn fact, one of the key factors contributing to our record gross profit margin for the full year was our value-added processing capabilities, which have expanded in recent years due to our substantial investments in cutting-edge equipment.\nAlthough the percentage of orders with value-added processing decreased to approximately 49% from 51% in 2019 due to pandemic-related changes in product mix, processed orders continue to stabilize our margins in challenging markets with declining demand and pricing trends.\nI will now provide a brief overview of the conditions in our key end markets.\nDemand in nonresidential construction, our largest market, remained relatively stable during the fourth quarter due to ongoing healthy bidding activity for new projects and the resumption of projects that had been suspended earlier in the year.\nWe've observed quoting activity in expected areas such as infrastructure projects, schools, utilities, water and power, strip malls, and data and distribution centers.\nDemand for our automotive toll processing services was strong, with activity returning to pre-pandemic levels in the fourth quarter as automotive manufacturers and steel and aluminum mills continued to increase production following reopenings after COVID-19 shutdowns in the second quarter of 2020.\nWe began operations at our new facility in Kentucky in late November and recently started construction on a new greenfield tolling facility in Texas, both focusing on carbon steel tolling to support increased capacity for our toll processing customers, who are primarily metal producers and their end users.\nDemand in heavy industry for both agricultural and construction equipment rebounded to solid levels in the fourth quarter as production schedules continued to ramp up following customer reopenings from COVID-19-related shutdowns and to meet equipment dealer restocking needs.\nSemiconductor demand steadily improved from the third quarter of 2020, and the market continues to be one of our strongest performers.\nDemand in commercial aerospace further declined in the fourth quarter as a direct result of reduced air travel due to COVID-19, which has lowered airplane production rates.\nWe believe the fourth quarter represented the lowest point for this sector.\nHowever, demand in the military, defense, and space segments of our aerospace business remained stable at solid levels throughout the fourth quarter.\nLastly, demand in the energy sector, primarily oil and natural gas, remained under pressure in the fourth quarter of 2020.\nThroughout 2020, we implemented prudent cost-reduction measures, including the closure of certain facilities, which helped improve our overall efficiency and position us to support a recovery in this market.\nWe are optimistic about both demand and pricing trends in the first quarter of 2021, as we have experienced strength in both areas so far this quarter.\nArthur will now review our financial results.\nI'll begin with our sales discussion.\nFourth quarter 2020 sales decreased by 12.8% compared to the same period last year as our markets continued to recover following the reopening of the economy.\nApproximately half of the decline in our sales can be attributed to our businesses supporting the commercial aerospace and energy end markets, as evidenced by the disproportionately larger decreases in our sales of aluminum and alloy products.\nFor the full year of 2020, sales decreased by 19.7% compared to 2019.\nAbout half of the sales decline was due to lower shipping volumes across all major end markets we serve, and the remaining half was due to lower average selling prices.\nNonetheless, the rebounding demand and improved pricing during the latter half of 2020 helped offset the yearly decrease in our revenue.\nWe achieved a record-breaking quarterly gross profit margin of 33% in Q4 2020, which was 60 basis points higher than both Q3 2020 and Q4 2019, as well as a full-year record gross profit margin of 31.5% for 2020, surpassing our previous annual record of 30.3% in 2019 by 120 basis points.\nOur non-GAAP FIFO gross profit margin in the last quarter of 2020 increased by 450 basis points compared to the same period in 2019, and for the entire year 2020, it rose by 280 basis points from the previous year.\nWe experienced a LIFO expense of $15.5 million in Q4 2020 due to rapidly rising mill costs for most of our products.\nNevertheless, for the full year 2020, we still recorded LIFO income of $22 million as our inventory cost at year-end remained below the levels at the beginning of the year.\nThis is in contrast to the LIFO income of $81 million and $156 million recorded in Q4 and the full year of 2019, respectively.\nWe concluded 2020 with a LIFO reserve of $115.6 million on our balance sheet.\nGiven current market conditions, we anticipate an annual LIFO expense of $340 million in 2021.\nIn line with our accounting practices, we distribute our annual estimate proportionally across each quarter.\nTherefore, our current projected LIFO expense for Q1 2021 is $85 million.\nAs we've done in previous years, we will revise our expectations each quarter based on inventory cost and metal pricing trends.\nOur Q4 non-GAAP SG&A expenses decreased by $51 million or 9.9% compared to Q4 2019, while shipments reduced by 7.9%.\nFor the entire year, same-store SG&A expenses dropped by $241 million or 11.5%, alongside a 10.8% reduction in shipments.\nThe reduction in SG&A expenses was observed across all major expense categories.\nAs we've mentioned before, about 60% to 65% of our SG&A expenses are related to personnel.\nRegarding the 11.5% year-over-year decrease in same-store SG&A expenses, approximately half of the reduction was personnel-related, with our headcount falling by 14% compared to the previous year.\nAdditionally, lower incentive pay due to reduced gross profit and pre-tax income levels contributed to the decrease in our compensation costs.\nAlthough we're starting Q1 2021 with a more efficient expense structure, we expect our expenses to increase from Q4 2020 due to strong volume and pricing trends, in line with seasonal patterns.\nI will discuss our Q1 2021 outlook for demand and pricing shortly.\nFor the full year 2020, our effective income tax rate decreased to 22.1% from 24% in 2019, primarily due to our lower pre-tax income in 2020.\nWe currently expect our full year 2021 effective income tax rate to be 24%.\nOur robust gross profit margin and effective expense management resulted in earnings of $2.01 per diluted share in Q4 2020, significantly exceeding our projected range of $1.30 to $1.40 per diluted share, but down 17.6% from $2.44 in Q4 2019, mainly due to reduced demand related to the pandemic, with commercial aerospace and energy end market sales significantly contributing to the decline.\nCompared to Q3 2020, Q4 non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $2.01 increased by 7.5% from $1.87, owing to improved pricing, strong gross profit margin, and recovering demand in most end markets.\nShifting focus to our balance sheet and cash flow.\nWe generated strong operational cash flow of $230.2 million in Q4 due to profitable operations and effective working capital management, including our focus on optimizing inventory levels.\nAt year-end, our total outstanding debt was $1.66 billion, resulting in a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.1 times.\nAdditionally, at year-end, we had no outstanding borrowings on our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility.\nAs mentioned in the previous quarter, we significantly enhanced our liquidity position through the successful completion of both our $900 million senior notes offering and amended/restated $1.5 billion five-year unsecured revolving credit facility.\nThe facility amendment, combined with the proceeds from the notes offering, provides us with ample liquidity and an improved debt maturity profile.\nI'll now discuss our outlook.\nWhile economic uncertainty due to the COVID-19 pandemic persists, favorable market conditions have continued into Q1 2021, with improving demand and additional mill price increases on many carbon and stainless steel products.\nThis environment allows us to maintain higher gross profit margins as we increase our selling prices before receiving higher-cost metal in our inventory.\nWe expect these favorable conditions to persist throughout Q1.\nGiven these favorable conditions and typical seasonal improvements, we estimate our Q1 2021 sales volume will increase by 10% to 12% compared to Q4 2020.\nWe also anticipate our average selling price in Q1 2021 will rise by 12% to 14% compared to Q4 2020.\nBased on these expectations, we currently project non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $3.40 to $3.50 for Q1 2021.\nIn conclusion, we are very satisfied with our Q4 2020 financial and operational results.\nThe exceptional performance of all our employees greatly contributed to our success in 2020.\nTheir efforts, combined with our resilient business model and disciplined strategy execution, resulted in another quarter of solid profitability and cash flow, enabling us to continue supporting our growth and stockholder return priorities.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Alternative financial measures not conforming to GAAP should not be used alone or as replacements for GAAP-based performance indicators.\nPlease be aware that information shared during this call is only current as of today.\nThe company has no plans or obligation to provide updates on this information in light of future events or circumstances.\nThis call is being recorded and will be made available on the company's website later today.\nWhile monitoring the Delta variant closely, we're encouraged by economic reopening, housing market strength, and our business's exceptional growth and performance.\nRobust operating income and increased portfolio values led to outstanding Q2 financials, with GAAP earnings of $0.66 per diluted share, far exceeding our $0.18 per share dividend.\nThis resulted in a 6.5% rise in our GAAP book value, reaching $11.46 per share by June 30th.\nOur 2021 performance so far demonstrates our ability to grow profitably while fulfilling our mission of providing quality housing access to all Americans.\nThis mission focuses on borrowers underserved by government loan programs or potentially excluded entirely.\nOur residential and business lending teams focus on the non-agency mortgage market, a sector largely overlooked recently due to lack of Federal Reserve stimulus.\nThe non-agency market encompasses residential mortgages outside government-backed programs.\nBy targeting this market rather than specific borrower profiles, our business isn't tied to homeownership rate trends.\nRedwood now offers a comprehensive product range serving both consumers and housing investors in a large market.\nMany predict significant increases in residential non-agency origination volumes for 2021, up from $435 billion in 2020.\nThis increase is just starting to reflect potential benefits from regulatory pullback on non-owner occupied loans, which could significantly boost our sector.\nWe maintained strong Q2 results despite more challenging market conditions than Q1.\nInterest rates rose in residential lending, largely due to uncertainty about potential changes in Fed support for the agency mortgage market.\nResulting intense competition and declining refinance activity led to industry-wide margin contraction.\nStrong competition effects were amplified by pro-cyclical and supply chain inflation signs, with yield curve shifts causing significant hedging and execution costs for large mortgage pipeline managers, including us.\nDespite these challenges, we locked nearly $4 billion in jumbo loans in Q2 at margins in the upper range of our historical targets.\nThe business purpose lending market became more competitive in Q2, with new entrants using rate sheets to enter the space, particularly for smaller bridge and rental loan products.\nThe trend of moving from apartments to single-family homes shows no signs of slowing, despite recent reopening of major metropolitan areas.\nThis has led to a scarcity of high-quality homes, with strong demand from both investors and consumers.\nIn many regions, rent growth has significantly lagged behind home price appreciation, highlighting the scarcity value of quality housing and multiple groups' focus on acquiring single-family homes.\nCapitalizing on its reputation as a flexible and dependable lifecycle lender, CoreVest, our BPL platform, surpassed $500 million in fundings for the quarter, balancing single-family rental and bridge originations.\nOur continued strong performance in this challenging environment showcases our strategic foundation and what makes Redwood unique.\nOur mortgage banking businesses offer complementary products that generate stable earnings streams.\nOur investment portfolio continues to show significant potential as the economy recovers.\nOur credit discipline and ability to create our own assets remain key differentiators.\nOur strategic foundation has enabled returns significantly outpacing our growing dividends.\nIn the first half of 2021, about 70% of Redwood's adjusted revenue came from mortgage banking operations, with the remaining 30% from our investment portfolio.\nWe expect mortgage banking and our taxable subsidiaries to continue driving strong earnings in the future.\nThe revenue generated through mortgage banking is nearly double the percentage contribution of recent years, highlighting the ongoing shift in our business model as we adapt to changing market conditions.\nThis also supports continued book value expansion over time, with retained earnings providing a zero-cost avenue for capital formation, reducing our marginal funding needs and contrasting with others in the space managing their balance sheets.\nBy continuously reinvesting in our infrastructure, both organically and through partnerships, we have a clear path to achieving transformative scale.\nAcross our enterprise, we've cultivated a talented and motivated workforce and embraced technology to serve our customers more efficiently than ever before.\nA prime example of this approach is last quarter's launch of our early-stage investment platform, RWT Horizons, which Dash will discuss in more detail.\nLooking ahead, we continue to improve, invest in our people and infrastructure, and approach our markets with a service standard that sets us apart from competitors.\nWe're excited by recent regulatory changes that have made the non-agency mortgage market more relevant than it has been in years.\nOur aim is to build a business that serves an important public mission, scales profitably, and generates attractive returns for our shareholders.\nOur Q2 results demonstrate continued strategic progress and strong operational momentum.\nWhile our comprehensive non-agency market presence benefited from ongoing strength in housing and credit markets, we combined these macro tailwinds with both new and familiar homegrown elements.\nOur team's typical efficient execution was enhanced by significant advancements in our technology infrastructure, both organic and through new partnerships already showing results.\nThe end product was another quarter of substantial outperformance.\nAs Chris mentioned, benchmark rates remain a key focus for the markets.\nThe Q2 rate increase has almost completely reversed, but uncertainty around government support levels for agency mortgages may moderate borrower refinance activity typically seen in such a rally.\nGiven this context, it's crucial to examine the main profitability drivers across our platforms.\nAs Chris noted, our target markets continue to expand as home price trends, evolving consumer housing demand, and significant regulatory shifts drive growth in non-agency's true potential market.\nWhile we're not immune to MBS price movements versus benchmark rates, our diverse distribution channels and unique product mix allow us to benefit from various demand drivers.\nFor instance, despite margin compression elsewhere during Q2, we maintained strong margins and volumes across both residential and business purpose lending.\nIn fact, reduced demand for agency mortgages represents another potential advantage for our business.\nMortgage originators are still expanding capacity to meet pent-up jumbo borrower demand, and as nationwide home prices rise along with preference for single-family detached rental housing, our BPL offerings remain highly sought after and our residential business continues to expand geographically.\nOur equity is now at its highest level in at least a decade, pushing more loan demand above conforming loan limits and into Redwood's target market.\nOur updated investor supplement indicates that 13 states now have significantly more loans year-to-date compared to the two years before the pandemic.\nThese states account for 35% of our year-to-date volume in locks, a trend we are monitoring closely.\nMarket analysts now predict single-family home price appreciation for 2021 to reach 14% for existing homes and 16% for new homes.\nEven if this growth slows as expected in 2022, we anticipate more areas across the country will become non-agency markets.\nThe regulatory landscape is another crucial factor.\nThe changing regulations are expected to substantially increase the Qualified Mortgage (QM) cohort, significantly benefiting high-quality expanded credit borrowers.\nMoreover, restrictions implemented earlier this year on GSE purchases of non-owner-occupied loans could expand the non-agency market by an estimated $25 to $35 billion annually.\nThere is potential for the non-agency market to further improve access to credit, particularly impacting first-time homebuyers and low-to-moderate income borrowers.\nThe availability of high-quality rental housing, including single-family detached homes, is also crucial, partially addressed by an increase in custom-built projects.\nAs previously discussed, housing supply has not kept pace with demand, and building material costs remain high despite some moderation, contributing to significant home price increases.\nSingle-family rental homes can satisfy the demand for more space in desirable neighborhoods at a monthly cost that more consumers can afford.\nThese supply-demand dynamics are reflected in record-high single-family rental occupancy rates, averaging 95% across the US, with single-family rents consistently exceeding multifamily rents since early last year.\nOur second quarter results support this broader market context.\nOperational highlights for the quarter included achieving our second-highest level of jumbo locks ever and our highest BPL volume since late 2019.\nAs Brooke will explain, book value increased by 6.5%, driven by asset appreciation through fair value changes and retained earnings from mortgage banking income at our taxable REIT subsidiary.\nOur platforms collectively distributed $3.6 billion of loans through direct sales and four securitizations.\nFollowing a record-breaking first quarter, our residential business recorded $3.9 billion in lock volume in Q2.\nAs expected, purchase money loans were a key driver, representing 60% of the quarter's lock volume.\nDespite interest rate challenges and competitive pressures affecting GSE-eligible production, the business achieved margins at the high end of our historical target range of 75 to 100 basis points, reflecting our diverse distribution channels and strong pipeline management amid broader market volatility.\nIn the second quarter, we sold $1.8 billion of loans and completed three Sequoia securitizations totaling $1.5 billion.\nDespite rate fluctuations during the quarter and a dramatic flattening of the yield curve after the June Fed meeting, our teams' end-to-end coordination and efficiency remained a true competitive advantage.\nThe flexibility of our securitization program combined with whole-loan distribution allows for further scaling by enabling us to be consistently present in the market.\nOnce again, we were quicker to market than our competitors in distributing our pipeline during the second quarter.\nAnother encouraging metric was the contribution of Redwood Choice, our expanded prime product, to overall volumes.\nChoice accounted for 15% of our locks in the second quarter, a significant increase from 5% in Q1.\nPre-pandemic, Choice represented up to 40% of our locks, reminding us of this channel's potential significance.\nIn recent public statements, we've continued to emphasize changes to the QM rules that we believe will be a key driver for Choice's resurgence.\nIf safely adopted, the new rules focusing on mortgage rate as the determinant of QM status will allow another segment of high-quality borrowers to more easily qualify for competitive rates, an important step highlighting the non-agency market's true potential to serve a broader range of consumers.\nWe are actively engaging with our seller base to bring this to fruition.\nThese macro trends also present significant opportunities for CoreVest, our business purpose lending platform.\nThe second quarter was particularly productive in BPL as we advanced several key initiatives, most notably completing our strategic investment in Churchill Finance.\nCoreVest originated $527 million overall in the second quarter, a 37% increase from Q1.\nOur funding mix consisted of $312 million in single-family rental loans and $215 million in bridge loans.\nBridge production increased by over 60% from Q1, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of growth, driven by increased borrower usage of credit lines and several build-for-rent and multifamily loans becoming available for funding.\nThe second quarter's BPL origination mix reflects the strength of our multi-product strategy, resulting in high levels of repeat borrowers, including those using more than one of our loan products.\nIn total, 67% of originations in the second quarter were from repeat customers, and the pipeline remains strong with a consistent mix of new loans and refinance opportunities.\nSFR production remained strong in the second quarter, with fundings up 23% from Q1.\nAs discussed in our previous call, the pipeline remains robust, and execution has benefited from an increasingly favorable securitization market.\nWe completed our first broadly syndicated CoreVest securitization of the year in April, achieving all-time low credit spreads with a deep bench of investors.\nThat record was short-lived, as last week's follow-on transaction once again priced at all-time lows, including a spread of 57 basis points on the AAA-rated securities.\nAs we've often seen, this type of execution inevitably attracts additional competition, which we view as an opportunity for CoreVest to further distinguish itself as the BPL market's preferred lender.\nWe have high expectations for our upcoming refreshed client portal, particularly its new user interface, which will simplify document uploading and loan progress tracking for our clients.\nAdditionally, we continue to leverage our advantages as a flexible lifecycle lender, refining our product suite to meet the end-to-end needs of an expanding group of sophisticated housing investors.\nHighlighting this progress is our partnership with Churchill, which we expect will diversify our sourcing channels, particularly focusing on smaller-balance single-family rental and bridge loans.\nWe have now closed our first purchase of bridge loans and SFR loans from Churchill and see an attractive near-term pipeline to complement our direct lending products.\nDuring periods of increased competition, it's crucial to emphasize the value of an institutional platform like CoreVest in a market that is still developing in many ways.\nWe have now completed optional calls on two CoreVest securitizations, refinancing many of the underlying loans made 5 or more years ago.\nMany borrowers have been with the platform for at least that long as CoreVest continues to support their growth and development.\nSuch a track record is significant and holds immense intangible value in the competitive landscape.\nOur newest initiative, RWT Horizons, is keeping pace with our enterprise-wide progress.\nSince formally launching Horizons earlier this year, we have completed five investments and are evaluating an exciting pipeline of new opportunities.\nOur recent direct investments include a platform using blockchain technology for the non-agency market and a tech-enabled residential construction management company.\nIt's encouraging to see concrete progress with our new collaborators at this early stage.\nLiquid Mortgage has secured a crucial patent covering most of its business plan, a significant advancement in our joint efforts to apply blockchain technology to the non-agency ecosystem.\nRent Room and Rent Butter have had productive quarters, meeting or surpassing their planned product development and rollout goals.\nThese partnerships exemplify the intellectual collaboration that generates true alpha for all involved parties.\nWe are working directly with Liquid Mortgage to develop the necessary processes for safely putting mortgages on blockchain, and jointly engaging other key industry stakeholders.\nFor Rent Room and Rent Butter, two investments sourced through CoreVest's borrower network, we are creating synergies with our broader client base.\nWe're excited to work closely with those at the forefront of innovation in our markets.\nAs previously mentioned, our second quarter 2021 results demonstrate the resilience of our model and continued strength across our entire platform.\nWe reported a GAAP book value per share of $11.46 as of June 30th, representing a 6.5% increase from the previous quarter.\nThe main factors contributing to the $0.70 increase in book value per share were GAAP earnings of $90 million or $0.77 per basic share, partially offset by our quarterly dividend of $0.18 per share.\nWe're pleased to have maintained strong momentum from the first quarter, achieving a total economic return on book value of 19% for the first half of 2021.\nOur economic return highlights not only our growth in book value but also our dividend growth, which we increased by another 13% in the second quarter.\nThis quarter saw particularly strong results from our business purpose mortgage banking operations, delivering a 52% after-tax operating return on capital with a net operating contribution of $20 million, an 80% increase from Q1 on a 37% rise in origination volumes.\nIncome from residential mortgage banking operations decreased from the historic first quarter level but still delivered an after-tax operating return of 17%.\nEven though loan purchase commitments were down 22%, Q2 still marks our second-highest volume on record.\nTo reiterate Dash's point, gross margins remained at the high end of our historical target range despite challenging macro conditions that affected securitization execution and increased hedging costs compared to the first quarter.\nRegarding the investment portfolio, we had $49 million of positive investment fair value changes, primarily from our RPL assets, due to further spread tightening and improved credit performance this quarter, which I'll elaborate on shortly.\nNet interest income increased by approximately 20% or nearly $5 million from the first quarter of 2021 due to higher average loan balances and inventory at our operating businesses, increased yield maintenance income from SFR securities, growth in our bridge loan portfolio, and reduced interest expenses from our investment portfolio.\nOn the tax front, we had REIT taxable income of $0.11 per share compared to $0.09 in the first quarter, mainly due to higher net interest income.\nOur taxable REIT subsidiaries earned $0.27 per share in Q2, down from $0.47 in Q1.\nThe decrease was primarily caused by lower mortgage banking income, partially offset by reduced operating expenses, resulting in a $5 million lower tax provision for the quarter.\nCombined, our operating businesses generated an annualized after-tax return of over 28% in Q2, utilizing $483 million of average capital.\nAs a reminder, these earnings can be reinvested into our operating businesses or paid as a dividend to the REIT.\nThis quarter, we continued to focus on higher-margin businesses that produce strategic assets for our investment portfolio.\nSpecifically, we allocated $45 million of capital to Brisbane during the quarter and $50 million to SFR securities in core loans.\nYear-to-date, we've reduced the size of our third-party investment portfolio through opportunistic sales.\nWorking capital for our mortgage banking businesses represented less than 30% of our allocated capital but produced approximately 65% of our adjusted revenue for the second quarter.\nAs Chris mentioned, the proportion of adjusted revenue from our mortgage banking operations has been growing in recent years, facilitating returns that significantly outpace our increasing dividends.\nTotal portfolio returns rose due to improved credit and faster prepayment speeds on securities we hold at a discount to face value.\nHigher prepayment speeds continue to benefit these portfolios and allow us to accelerate our call options within Sequoia and CoreVest Securities.\nWe exercised call rights on three Sequoia securitizations and one CoreVest securitization during the second quarter, acquiring $83 million of seasoned jumbo loans and $45 million of seasoned SFR loans, all at par, which benefited book value by $0.05 per share.\nWe estimate about $250 million to $300 million of expected call activity across CoreVest and Sequoia through the remainder of the year, and at current market conditions, we expect the underlying loans can generally be sold or resecuritized well above their par value, potentially creating further upside to earnings and book value of approximately $0.68 per share for 2021.\nFurthermore, we project another $2 billion of loans that could become callable by the end of 2024, with the majority expected to occur by the end of 2022, potentially adding another $0.63 to $0.65 per share on average to book value, depending on execution.\nNet delinquencies in our portfolio continue to improve, with new forbearance requests near zero.\nSpecifically, Choice and RPL securities experienced improved 90-day delinquencies during the quarter, with Select remaining flat from Q1 at very low levels of 80 basis points.\nIt's worth noting the improved delinquency trends, with our RPL securities portfolio experiencing 60-day delinquencies now below pre-COVID levels, and voluntary prepayment speeds continuing to exceed our original modeled expectations.\nLTVs in the portfolio are low and continue to improve or remain stable, and average coupons exceed our current mortgage rate, which should provide options to help distressed borrowers and keep actual losses low.\nAt quarter-end, our balance sheet and funding profile were in excellent shape following several liability and capital management actions taken during the quarter.\nWe added over $750 million of financing capacity to support growth of our operating platforms, including the refinance of a $242 million bridge loan financing, which contributed to a roughly 100 basis point cost of funds improvement for our overall investment portfolio.\nImportantly, the second quarter marked another record for Redwood with combined $3.3 billion of residential whole loan sales and securitizations, underscoring our ability to source and distribute in size.\nOur recourse leverage was slightly higher at 2.2 times at the end of the second quarter as we incurred additional warehouse borrowings to finance higher loan inventory.\nAt June 30th, our unrestricted cash was $421 million, which is over half the size of our outstanding marginable debt, and at quarter-end, our investable capital was $175 million, not including $100 million of incremental capital generated from a secured term financing we closed in early July.\nTo conclude, I'll provide an update on our 2021 financial outlook.\nWe continue to see potential for growth in our book value, both from anticipated call activity in our investment portfolio and through our ability to grow and retain earnings at our taxable REIT subsidiary.\nWe encourage you to review the supplemental quarterly materials we published earlier today, which provide more detailed and updated guidance for the remainder of the year to highlight some of the key factors that support our financial narrative.\nOur confidence in achieving our guidance is based on sustainable trends we're observing across our businesses.\nAs Chris and Dash have outlined, the key themes driving our performance include increasing our market share, using technology to improve efficiency, allocating more capital to our higher ROE operating platforms, continuing to create value through the investment portfolio, and using partnerships, M&A, and other growth strategies to further our efforts in our target markets.\nLooking ahead, we remain on track to maintain the robust volumes we've seen through the first half of the year, anticipating another $6 to $8 billion of jumbo locks and approximately $1 billion of BPL originations for the second half of the year, which would nearly double the volume of that business year-over-year.\nFor perspective, the second half volumes on the residential front approach our full-year volume from just a couple of years ago.\nWe've demonstrated our ability to successfully grow not only our origination volume but also our market share, and we believe we can continue to do that across our platform and in each of its underlying channels.\nSmall changes in market share can significantly impact our overall profitability and scale, and that's what we plan to achieve over time.\nFor the remainder of the year, we anticipate generating an adjusted return on allocated capital between 20% to 25% from our mortgage banking operations, and 10% to 12% for the investment portfolio.\nAs credit spreads have tightened significantly and fair values have since increased, this forward yield on the investment portfolio, which aligns with our forecast at the beginning of the year, reflects improvements in our financing costs and capital optimization.\nFinally, regarding potential sources of book value upside, we began the year with $444 million of net accretable discount in our portfolio, and even after growing book value by $1.55 per share or roughly $175 million since then, we have approximately $2.60 per share or $300 million of remaining discount in the portfolio that we have the potential to recognize over time.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:I will be giving a presentation today alongside Eric Thornburg, who serves as Chairman of the Board, President and CEO, as well as Andy Gere, who holds the position of President and COO at San Jose Water Company\nAccompanying slides for our presentation can be found on our company website at www\nThese statements are based on the company's estimates and assumptions, considering its experience, historical patterns, current situation, and anticipated future developments, as well as other factors deemed appropriate by the company given the circumstances\nI will now hand the call over to Eric\nMy name is Eric Thornburg, and I have the privilege of serving as Chairman, President and CEO of SJW Group\nWe have now been dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic for over 13 months\nThere's a growing sense of guarded optimism that we've seen the worst of the pandemic, and we're beginning to plan for a safe return to our offices and work locations\nThroughout the past year, we've gained valuable insights about our teams, our company culture, our adaptability, and what we can accomplish through remote work\nDespite facing numerous challenges, our employees have embodied our mission as trusted professionals who are passionate about providing essential, high-quality water and exceptional service to families and communities, while also protecting the environment and ensuring a fair return for shareholders\nLooking forward, we are preparing for a gradual return to our offices and work sites, building upon the risk-based approach that has served us well over the past year\nWe will follow the safety guidelines provided by our national, state, and local health authorities\nOur primary objective remains unchanged throughout the pandemic: to fulfill our public health mission as a water service provider while protecting our employees, customers, and communities\nThe executive leadership team and I eagerly anticipate the day when we can personally express our gratitude to all employees and meet the new team members who have joined us over the past year without having physically been in our offices\nWe are dedicated to implementing a safe return that capitalizes on the benefits of remote work while providing a secure physical environment that fosters collaboration and nurtures our company culture\nThe extreme cold and winter weather that hit Texas in February demonstrated the advantages of being a pure-play water and wastewater utility with national reach, geographic diversity, and locally focused operations\nSJW Group was able to utilize resources from our East and West Coast operations to support our Texas operation during the event\nOur communications teams from both coasts assisted with customer notifications, website updates, social media posts, and news media communications, while our operations and safety teams provided crucial incident support\nThe direct experience of our Connecticut and Maine teams in dealing with cold weather events proved valuable in our response\nIn California, the majority of the rainfall season is now behind us\nWe have experienced below-average precipitation for the second year in a row, which is impacting our available surface water supplies from our watershed\nThe extremely low precipitation in the Santa Cruz Mountains this winter has significantly affected our local surface water operations, both in terms of storm runoff collected at creek intakes for immediate treatment and the volume of water we've been able to store in our Lake Elsman reservoir for later release\nFor the first time in my 25-year tenure at San Jose Water, we are temporarily shutting down our Montevina Water Treatment Plant due to low supply\nWe will resume operations at the plant when hydrologic conditions permit\nTo provide context, the chart on Slide 10 illustrates the historical surface water production in blue compared to the associated rainfall at Lake Elsman in red over the same period\nAs you can see, there has only been one other year, 2014, where we observed such low levels of rainfall and surface water production\nFortunately, the regional water supply situation is somewhat better, and despite the low rainfall and snowpack this winter, the total groundwater storage at the end of the first quarter remained at Stage One or normal of Valley Water's water shortage contingency plan\nBased on available recharge and the current rate of withdrawal, Valley Water reports that it expects to remain in the normal range through year-end by supplementing normal supplies with additional imported water\nThis is positive news for the upcoming summer months when demand is typically highest, and we anticipate adequate supplies to serve our customers\nDue to the water supply situation in California, we expect increases in our operating costs as we rely more on purchased water from our wholesaler to meet customer needs in 2021\nCurrently, every billion gallons of purchased water costs the company an additional $4.2 million compared to using our own supply sources\nAs a direct result of the water supply outlook and in the interest of full transparency, we are announcing guidance of $1.85 to $2.05 per diluted share for 2021\nThis projection assumes no additional company-produced surface water in California for the remainder of 2021\nWe are currently updating our strategic water supply plan to evaluate current and future supply reliability and resiliency\nOur ongoing California general rate case proceeding will address the impact of surface water availability\nPrudent management of our business and financial resources continues to be essential to our growth and ability to return capital to shareholders\nWe take pride in having consistently paid a dividend for over 77 years and increasing the annual dividend for each of the past 53 years, delivering value to our shareholders\nFollowing Jim's comments, I will discuss regulatory and other business-related issues.\nOur Q1 operational results reflect newly approved revenues from our 2019 California general rate case.\nRevenue increases were authorized in Connecticut and Maine for water infrastructure improvements, and customer growth occurred in Texas.\nThese gains were counterbalanced by reduced customer usage, the effects of a February ice storm in Texas, and decreased availability of affordable surface water due to dry conditions in California, as Eric and Andy mentioned earlier.\nQ1 revenue reached $114.8 million, representing a 1% increase compared to Q1 2020.\nThe quarter's net income was $2.6 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, showing an 8% rise from the $2.4 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, reported in Q1 2020.\nThe quarterly increase in diluted earnings per share was mainly due to cumulative rate hikes of $0.08 per share, accumulated cost reductions of $0.04 per share, a $0.04 per share tax benefit, and a $0.03 per share rise in nonregulated income.\nThis per-share increase was partially mitigated by a $0.08 per share decline in customer usage.\nCustomer rebates in Texas amounting to $0.02 per share related to the February ice storm, a $0.02 per share reduction in surface water availability, and a $0.06 per share increase in depreciation and amortization also offset the gains.\nOur revenue decrease resulted from a $2.8 million drop in customer usage.\nAdditionally, customer rebates in Texas lowered revenue by $700,000, and net adjustments in certain balancing and memorandum accounts reduced revenue by $600,000.\nThese decreases were partly offset by $2.8 million in cumulative rate increases and $500,000 in revenue from new customers.\nTotal water production costs for Q1 2021 were slightly lower compared to Q1 2020.\nThis minor reduction was primarily due to $800,000 in lower average per-unit costs for purchased water, groundwater extraction, and energy charges, along with reduced usage, partially counterbalanced by a $700,000 increase from purchasing additional water supplies to compensate for the lower surface water production during the quarter.\nOther operating expenses rose by $1.6 million or 2% for the quarter, mainly due to $2.1 million in higher depreciation related to utility plant additions, and $200,000 in increased maintenance expenses, partially offset by $400,000 in reduced general and administrative expenses.\nFurthermore, in Q1 2020, we incurred $400,000 in merger-related expenses, which were not present in 2021.\nThe effective consolidated income tax rates were approximately negative 52% and 15% for the quarters ending March 31, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\nThe lower effective tax rate for Q1 2021 was primarily due to excess tax benefits related to share-based payment awards, state tax credits, and other discrete tax items.\nRegarding our capital expenditure program, we added $46.7 million in company-funded utility plant during Q1 2021.\nThis represents 20% of our total planned capital expenditures for 2021.\nFrom a financial perspective, Q1 2021 cash flows from operations increased by 321% compared to Q1 2020.\nThis change was mainly due to an $8.3 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses, a $2.2 million increase in accounts receivable collections, and a $1.5 million rise in net income adjusted for non-cash items.\nAdditionally, in 2020, we made a $5 million upfront payment to the city of Cupertino for our service concession agreement and refunded $8.4 million to California ratepayers from our 2017 Tax Act Memorandum Account, which did not occur in 2021.\nIn March 2021, SJW Group issued approximately 1.2 million new shares in an offering that raised net proceeds of about $66.9 million.\nThe proceeds were used to repay outstanding balances on the company's credit facilities and for general corporate purposes.\nMoreover, in April 2021, the company's California subsidiary entered into a $140 million credit agreement, and the Texas subsidiary entered into a $5 million credit agreement, both with JPMorgan Chase Bank.\nThese new credit agreements replaced the existing JPMorgan Chase credit agreements, which were paid off and set to mature and expire on June 1, 2021.\nAt the end of Q1, we had $138 million available on our bank lines of credit for short-term financing of utility plant additions and operating activities.\nThe average borrowing rate on line of credit advances during the quarter was 1.42%.\nSJW Group continues to implement our core growth strategy of investing in high-quality water systems to provide safe and reliable water service to customers and communities while earning a fair return on those investments.\nAs Jim mentioned, we have already invested approximately 20% of our planned 2021 capital spending by the end of Q1.\nWe maintain high-quality water systems throughout our service areas and are investing to sustain them for the benefit of customers, communities, and shareholders.\nOther regulatory developments in Q1 include the filing of general rate cases for both San Jose Water and Connecticut Water in January.\nSan Jose Water's GRC application proposes a $435 million capital program for 2021 through 2023, supported by our award-winning enterprise asset management system.\nUpdated rates are anticipated to take effect in the initial three months of 2022.\nCalifornia utilizes a forward-looking test year, authorizing capital expenditure levels during each general rate case cycle.\nConnecticut, Texas, and Maine use a historical test year approach, where capital investments and expenses not recoverable through surcharge mechanisms are recouped in subsequent general rate case filings after they've been made.\nConnecticut Water's current general rate case is their first since the previous ruling in 2010.\nA key factor driving the case is the $266 million invested in infrastructure that is currently benefiting customers but not yet reflected in rates.\nThe Connecticut Public Utilities Regulatory Authority (PURA) is expected to deliver a verdict in the third quarter.\nConnecticut Water's rate case also proposes tiered pricing for residential customers to encourage water conservation.\nIn Connecticut, PURA-regulated water utilities can collect their authorized revenues regardless of usage through a water revenue adjustment mechanism, which reduces the risk of such a rate design and supports state conservation policy goals.\nPURA approved a 1.1% increase in the Water Infrastructure and Conservation Adjustment (WICA) surcharge earlier this year, which became effective on April 1.\nThis covers $8.7 million in qualified infrastructure investments and will generate additional annual revenue of approximately $1 million.\nThe existing cumulative WICA surcharge will be incorporated into base rates, and the surcharge will be reset to zero as part of the general rate case.\nMaine Water submitted a general rate case application for its Biddeford Saco rate division to the Maine Public Utilities Commission (PUC) in March, requesting a $6.7 million increase in annual revenues.\nThe application is motivated by a $60 million replacement of the 1884 vintage drinking water treatment plant.\nMaine Water's proposal includes an innovative approach to spread the increase over three years in roughly equal amounts.\nA decision on the rate smoothing mechanism to authorize a customer surcharge beginning in the third quarter of 2021 is anticipated in the second quarter, with a ruling on the requested revenue increase expected in the second quarter of 2022, coinciding with the completion of the new water treatment facility.\nThese various state regulatory filings include capital investments that provide long-term benefits to customers, communities, and shareholders by enhancing our ability to deliver safe, high-quality, and reliable water service while increasing the rate base, which drives company earnings.\nWe are aware of the economic impact that COVID-19 has had on some of our customers over the past year.\nConnecticut Water is suggesting a 15% discount on water bills for income-eligible customers, similar to a program offered by San Jose Water since late 2005.\nSan Jose Water plans to propose a debt forgiveness plan for its Water Rate Assistance Plan (WRAP) low-income customers.\nThe proposal includes tracking the forgiven amount in San Jose Water's WRAP balancing account for potential future recovery.\nOn April 9, SJWTX, our Texas Water and Wastewater Utility, finalized the agreement to acquire the Clear Water Estates Water System.\nThis marks the first acquisition completed by a regulated water utility under the state's new fair market value regulation.\nThe acquisition added 230 new customers, secured additional water supplies for current and future customers, and increased the rate base to reflect market value for future rate-making purposes.\nMore significantly, the acquisition demonstrated that the fair market value process functioned as intended.\nThis was the 13th acquisition completed by SJWTX, which has tripled its customer base since 2006.\nThe company serves two of the four fastest-growing counties in the United States.\nWith a diverse portfolio of water supplies and continued growth in customer base through organic expansion and acquisitions, we remain optimistic about SJWTX's prospects and its increased contributions to consolidated earnings.\nWe are dedicated to investing in our culture, diversity, and the environment.\nOur diversity, equity, and inclusion council has sincerely and authentically guided our commitment to further develop our diverse and inclusive culture.\nWe aim to expand our supplier diversity programs to extend our efforts into the broader community.\nAt the Board level, SJW Group is one of only 154 companies in the Russell 3000 to achieve a gender-balanced board rating in 2020, according to the 50/50 Women on Boards Gender Diversity Index.\nWe have established the groundwork for creating a comprehensive greenhouse gas inventory across all our operations, which will allow us to set meaningful reduction goals for the future and develop prudent plans to achieve those goals.\nBob has been a Director of the company since 2006 and Lead Independent Director since 2015.\nBob's expertise in the water industry is unparalleled, and his contributions to our company and stockholders are extensive.\nFurthermore, you would be hard-pressed to find a person in business with more integrity, character, and genuine commitment to serving our company, customers, employees, and communities than Bob.\nOn behalf of the Board and all our employees, we extend our best wishes to him.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:This teleconference is the intellectual property of SYNNEX Corporation and cannot be recorded or broadcast without prior authorization.\nI will now highlight key points from the third quarter and provide guidance for the fourth quarter.\nDespite ongoing economic uncertainty in these challenging times, our revenue, net income, and diluted earnings per share all surpassed our projections, demonstrating our resilience and expertise.\nOur reported GAAP results, while still affected by COVID, have not been adjusted to account for COVID-19 related expenses.\nWhen relevant, I will mention the financial impact of COVID-19 on our third quarter performance.\nOverall, our total revenue reached a third quarter record of $6.5 billion, representing a 4% increase from $6.2 billion in the same period last year.\nAdjusting for currency fluctuations, revenue grew by 5% compared to the previous year's quarter.\nOur total consolidated gross profit amounted to $708 million, a decrease of 2% or $18 million from the previous year, with gross margin at 11% compared to 11.7% a year ago.\nTotal adjusted selling, general, and administrative expenses were $448 million, or 7% of revenue, a reduction of $8 million from the same quarter last year.\nConsolidated non-GAAP operating income was $260 million, a decrease of $10 million or 4% from the previous year.\nNon-GAAP operating margin of 4% was 34 basis points lower than the same period last year.\nLet's now examine the third quarter operating performance by business segment.\nTechnology Solutions revenue reached $5.3 billion, an increase of 5% or $258 million compared to the same quarter last year.\nThe gross margin for Technology Solutions was 5.6%, which was 37 basis points lower than the previous year's quarter, mainly due to changes in product mix.\nOperating income for this segment was $132 million, a decrease of $6 million from the previous year.\nNon-GAAP operating income for Technology Solutions was $142 million, a 5% or $7 million decrease from the same quarter last year.\nThe non-GAAP operating margin was 2.7%, which is 29 basis points lower than a year ago.\nTechnology Solutions incurred approximately $8 million in COVID-19 related net additional expenses for the quarter, primarily consisting of increased allowances for doubtful accounts, staffing costs, and work-from-home expenses.\nTurning to Concentrix, its revenue was $1.2 billion, a slight increase of 24 basis points compared to the same quarter last year.\nConcentrix's gross margin was 35.5%, showing a 308 basis point improvement sequentially, but a 126 basis point decrease compared to the same quarter last year, mainly due to COVID-19 impacts.\nNon-GAAP operating income for Concentrix this quarter was $118 million, a decrease of $3 million in absolute terms or 2% compared to last year.\nThe non-GAAP operating margin for Concentrix was 10.1%, compared to 5.9% in the second fiscal quarter and 10.4% a year ago.\nConcentrix faced approximately $13 million in net additional expenses related to COVID-19 for the quarter.\nReturning to our consolidated results, the third quarter net total interest expense and finance charges were $29 million, a $14 million reduction compared to the same quarter last year.\nThis decrease was due to lower average outstanding borrowings compared to the previous year's quarter, as well as a lower interest rate environment.\nWe anticipate interest expenses of approximately $29 million for the fourth quarter.\nTotal non-GAAP net income was $173 million, an increase of $3 million or 2% over the same period last year, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $3.33, an increase of $0.03 or 1% compared to the same period a year ago.\nThe effective tax rate for the third quarter was 25.2%, compared to 25.3% a year ago.\nWe expect the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 to be approximately 25%.\nExamining the balance sheet, our accounts receivable totaled $3.6 billion and inventories amounted to $2.8 billion as of August 31, 2020.\nOur cash conversion cycle for the third quarter was 38 days, 11 days shorter than a year ago and 8 days better than last quarter, resulting in preliminary cash flow from operations of $321 million.\nThis improvement was achieved through continued collaboration with our partners and faster inventory turnover.\nAt the end of the third quarter, SYNNEX had approximately $2.8 billion in total available liquidity to fund operations, including cash and credit facilities.\nI'd like to provide an update on the Concentrix spin-off.\nWe're on track for a spin-off in the fourth quarter of the calendar year, with December 1 being the most likely date.\nThis aligns with our year-end and provides a clean start for both Concentrix and SYNNEX in 2020.\nBased on current estimates, SYNNEX Corp's gross debt will be approximately $2.6 billion, with Concentrix receiving about $1.1 billion and SYNNEX receiving about $1.5 billion.\nThe majority of cash on hand, estimated to be around $700 million at the time of the spin-off, will be held by SYNNEX.\nCash usage in the fourth quarter will be for normal seasonal purposes and debt reduction.\nAs previously discussed, we aim to position both companies favorably among their peers in terms of leverage and liquidity.\nThese debt figures are estimates and may change based on fourth-quarter performance.\nWe have made significant progress with our bankers in securing third-party financing for Concentrix and are confident in the capital structure of both businesses.\nBoth SYNNEX and Concentrix will have sufficient resources to support growth and potential M&A opportunities.\nLooking ahead to our fourth quarter forecast, we anticipate revenue to fall between $6.45 billion and $6.65 billion.\nWe project non-GAAP net income to range from $191 million to $204 million.\nOur estimate for non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is between $3.68 and $3.93 per diluted share, based on approximately 51.5 million weighted average shares.\nThe guidance for non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share does not include after-tax expenses of about $37.5 million or $0.72 per share, associated with intangible amortization and acquisition-related and integration costs.\nWe've previously informed you about an important customer transitioning to a consignment model.\nThe exact date for this transition remains uncertain and won't occur in early 2021.\nWe'll update you as soon as we have a clear start date.\nI'd like to express my gratitude to all our global stakeholders for their ongoing support and collaboration as we've jointly navigated numerous challenges and economic issues throughout 2020.\nOur team delivered exceptional results in the third quarter, for which I'm deeply thankful.\nWhile we're all feeling the strain of the ongoing pandemic, the SYNNEX spirit and determination continue to be a source of inspiration.\nI observe the positive influence we're having on our communities and the strong backing our teams provide to each other, our partners, and customers.\nIn addition to achieving great quarterly results, the team made significant progress on our planned spin-off of Concentrix into an independent public company.\nThe Concentrix F-10 document is now available for review.\nThird-party financing is nearly complete, and most remaining spin-related activities are close to finalization.\nConsequently, we believe we're well-positioned to conclude this transaction in the fourth quarter of the calendar year.\nRegarding our third quarter performance, our TS distribution business saw better-than-expected revenue driven by strong demand in education, state and local government, and e-commerce sectors.\nThis was fueled by ongoing needs for remote work, learning, and shopping.\nWe also saw a slight improvement from the second quarter in office environment and SMB sales.\nSimilar to Q2, we experienced higher demand for notebooks, Chromebooks, cloud services, collaboration tools, and security products.\nCompared to the previous year, we saw some weakness in products supporting office environments, such as desktop PCs, printers, supplies, and on-site datacenter equipment.\nGeographically, North America was the top performer, but all regions exceeded expectations during the quarter.\nOverall, TS distribution experienced year-over-year growth.\nOur TS Hive business showed sequential improvement and year-over-year revenue growth as we continued supporting our largest customers in Q3.\nThe mix of programs delivered leaned towards higher volume, lower margin products, but we're generally satisfied with the Q3 results.\nOur Concentrix business also surpassed expectations in Q3, despite known challenges.\nI'm very pleased with our performance, and I'll now hand over to Chris to provide more details about Concentrix.\nWe're very satisfied with our continued momentum, both in terms of business execution and readiness for the spin-off, which as Marshall mentioned, is set for early December.\nWe achieved solid results, returning to pre-COVID revenue growth rates and double-digit adjusted operating margins.\nConcentrix's third quarter revenue totaled $1.16 billion, slightly higher than the same period last year.\nSequentially, third quarter revenue increased across all our delivery regions.\nThis achievement was possible due to our aggressive approach to addressing COVID-19 challenges in three key areas.\nFirst, we provided a flexible, safe workplace incorporating both at-home and in-office elements to meet our clients' needs.\nSecond, we leveraged our robust technology solutions to support clients across all channels.\nThird, we fostered a culture of security and integrity, backed by innovations like our recently announced SecureCX platform.\nSecureCX is a proprietary platform that uses advanced technology to ensure nearly equivalent security levels at home as in an office setting.\nThis is the latest innovation from our team of over 1,000 skilled engineers and developers.\nConcentrix has been developing technology-driven solutions like this for more than a decade, and we plan to continue leading through investment in this area.\nWe're also pleased with our progress in diversifying our vertical mix.\nThe communications vertical now accounts for about 21% of revenue, representing a 4% impact on our year-over-year growth rate, but resulting in a more balanced portfolio.\nAs anticipated, our clients in the travel, transportation, and tourism sectors were impacted by COVID-19, causing an additional 2% impact on growth.\nThese headwinds were more than offset by strong growth from clients in our technology, healthcare, financial services, and e-commerce verticals, which collectively represent about two-thirds of our business.\nNew business signings were very encouraging in the quarter, reaching a record level of expected annualized contract revenue.\nThis increased demand reflects the value our clients place on the strengths of our best-in-class CX platform and our ability to meet their evolving needs.\nWe are expanding our market presence with robust acquisitions across our key sectors and securing new contracts that were traditionally handled in-house.\nDespite our record-breaking deals, our business prospects remain robust and expanding.\nWe are closely monitoring COVID-19 developments and are prepared to adjust our strategies with our clients as their requirements evolve.\nRegarding profitability, our adjusted operating income for the quarter reached $118 million or 10.1%, nearly matching last year's performance.\nThe return to double-digit operating margin reflects revenue outperformance and reduced variable expenses, despite an additional $13 million in net COVID-19 related costs.\nOperating cash flow in the third quarter amounted to roughly $91 million.\nCapital expenditures totaled approximately $37 million.\nWe achieved positive free cash flow, notwithstanding the impact of previous quarter's revenue reductions that decreased our collections in the third quarter.\nWe anticipate capital expenditures to be slightly higher than usual to support growth and reconfigure some of our facilities due to COVID-19.\nFor the fourth quarter outlook, we remain committed to ensuring our staff's safety, exceeding client expectations to remain their preferred partner, and emerging stronger from the pandemic to drive sequential improvements in both revenue and profitability.\nIn the fourth quarter, we anticipate greater sequential revenue growth compared to last year, stemming from strong new business signings in the third quarter and seasonal increases.\nConsequently, we project fourth quarter revenue to rise by at least 2% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, with an expected adjusted operating margin above 12.5%.\nWe remain confident in our ability to surpass industry growth rates while improving our adjusted operating margin over time.\nRegarding our separation from SYNNEX, scheduled for December 1, we believe we are fully prepared.\nWe plan to announce our Board of Directors in an updated Form 10 Registration Statement in early October.\nWe take pride in the fact that our Board will reflect the diversity present in our business.\nAs Marshall mentioned, our debt to EBITDA ratio will be less than approximately two times upon separation, providing strong liquidity and significant flexibility for investing in organic and inorganic growth.\nWe maintain a disciplined approach to both organic and inorganic growth strategies.\nWe believe the spin-off will yield benefits for shareholders, team members, and clients alike.\nAn analyst event will be held in early November before the spin-off, followed by one-on-one investor meetings shortly after.\nI'm eager to update you in the coming weeks about the extraordinary opportunity and our superior capability to lead in the customer experience industry.\nThe effort, resourcefulness, and dedication demonstrate the strength of our people, culture, and diversity, which we'll leverage as we begin this new chapter of Concentrix.\nRegarding our fourth quarter outlook, our main priority remains the safety and well-being of our associates.\nFor our business overall, we observe positive signs of continued recovery as economies further reopen.\nHowever, we remain cautious due to significant variations between and within geographical regions.\nFor Technology Solutions, we anticipate an overall seasonal improvement in Q4.\nWe expect TS distribution to increase sequentially, partially offset by a decline in TS Hive.\nTS distribution growth will be driven by ongoing strength in remote enablement, the federal buying season, progress in delayed on-premise projects, and continued investment in digital transformation.\nWe anticipate a solid quarter for TS Hive, although we'll be comparing it to an exceptional Q4 last year.\nGiven the unpredictability of this business, we tend to use conservative internal expectations in our guidance calculations.\nAs Marshall indicated, COVID-related expenses decreased in Q3 and are expected to decline further in Q4.\nAs mentioned in our previous call, a portion of these costs will become part of our normal TS operating expenses going forward.\nOver time, we expect to find ways to offset these costs while maintaining the most effective and efficient business operations possible.\nFor Concentrix, as Chris mentioned, we anticipate a seasonally strong Q4.\nOur return to growth, positive cash flow, and robust pipeline are among the many aspects I'm pleased about as Concentrix approaches independence.\nI'm also excited about the independent TS, our ongoing opportunities to enhance our core operations, the numerous investments we've made to organically grow our business, and the potential for inorganic investments, all of which give me confidence in our business and the services we provide to our partners.\nAdditionally, we will continue to pursue our goal of outpacing market growth and increasing our profit at a higher rate.\nWe are grateful for your support of SYNNEX during these challenging times.\nOur thoughts remain with those affected by COVID-19; please stay safe and healthy.\nWe also stand with those working towards positive change on social issues.\nI appreciate the SYNNEX team members who have been of service in these and other important areas.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Certain projections and assumptions form the basis of these declarations, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties.\nWe recommend reviewing the risk factors outlined in the company's publicly available documents and reports, accessible on the SEC website or the company's official website.\nLet me now hand over the conference to Karen Colonias, who serves as Simpson's President and Chief Executive Officer.\nI'll start by summarizing our results for the entire year of 2020, then move on to discuss the key factors and initiatives that influenced our fourth quarter performance.\nBrian will then provide a more detailed explanation of our financial results and our business outlook for fiscal 2021.\nI'm incredibly proud of our outstanding financial and operational achievements in 2020, which we accomplished despite the challenging operating conditions brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOur net sales grew by 11.6% compared to 2019, reaching $1.28 billion, the highest in our company's history, driven by strong sales volume.\nConsequently, we achieved record earnings of $4.27 per diluted share, a 43.3% increase from 2019.\nThese accomplishments wouldn't have been possible without the dedication and hard work of all our Simpson employees.\nTheir diligence, including strict adherence to protocols aimed at minimizing the spread of COVID-19, has allowed us to continue operating our business with minimal disruptions from the pandemic.\nOn behalf of the entire Simpson management team, we commend them for their extraordinary efforts.\nEnsuring the health, safety, and well-being of all our employees remains our top priority, and we will continue to strive for improvements to make Simpson a safe and rewarding workplace.\nOur record-breaking 2020 results were further bolstered by our commitment to positioning Simpson for long-term, sustainable, and increasingly profitable growth.\nIn October 2017, we introduced a three-year plan for 2020 with ambitious targets to maximize our operational efficiencies and enhance long-term shareholder value.\nSince then, we've made significant progress towards our goals, some of which we updated in July 2019 to reflect changes in the macroeconomic landscape.\nAlthough we decided to withdraw these financial targets in April 2020 due to the significant uncertainty surrounding COVID-19, we continued to execute based on the same underlying principles, focusing on operational efficiencies and cost savings to guide us through the pandemic.\nSimultaneously, our business experienced certain advantages due to the COVID-19 related macroeconomic conditions, specifically favorable steel prices, temporary reductions in travel and related operating expenses, and an increase in repair and remodel activity.\nThe combination of these factors allowed us to meet or exceed nearly all of our ambitious 2020 plan objectives.\nWe are very proud of these achievements and I'd like to take a few moments to discuss them with you.\nOur primary 2020 plan objective was to maintain a focus on organic growth.\nWe aimed to achieve a compound annual growth rate in net sales of approximately 8% from 2016 to 2020.\nBy the end of 2020, we had significantly surpassed this target, achieving a compound annual growth rate of over 10% relative to our 2016 baseline.\nKey milestones supporting this goal included a price increase for most of our US wood connector products in the third quarter of 2018, signing one of the largest US homebuilding companies to our builder program (resulting in 23 of the Top 25 US builders now participating in our program), strong repair and remodel trends associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, and the return of Lowe's as a home center customer in mid-2020.\nOur second objective involved streamlining our cost structure to enhance company-wide profitability.\nWe aimed to reduce our total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales from 31.3% in 2016 to a range of 26% to 27% by the end of 2020.\nWe approached this through a combination of zero-based budgeting, reducing our indirect procurement costs, and implementing other cost-cutting measures in both Europe and our concrete business.\nAdditionally, in 2020, we experienced significant cost savings from our expense management practices as well as one-time benefits from reduced travel and trade show costs due to COVID-19 restrictions.\nThese factors, combined with strong topline growth, enabled us to exceed our operating expense target.\nFor the full year of 2020, we recorded operating expenses as a percentage of net sales of 25.6%, representing a 570 basis point improvement compared to 2016.\nOur next goal was to improve our operating income margin to a range of 16% to 17% by the end of 2020.\nWe surpassed this target as our gross margin significantly benefited from lower material costs and limited spending on operating expenses due to COVID-19 restrictions.\nWe reported an operating income margin of 19.9% for 2020, a 350 basis point improvement compared to 16.4% in 2016.\nAt the consolidated level, our gross margin improvement was supported by enhanced gross margins in our concrete business, another 2020 plan goal.\nFollowing the unveiling of the 2020 plan, we implemented a new concrete strategy in late 2017 by focusing on six distinct product categories.\nBy concentrating on these higher margin products to increase profitability, we exceeded our goal of improving our global concrete gross margin from 34.7% in 2016 to 42% in 2020.\nOur final profitability goal was to improve our operating income margin in Europe.\nWe've made substantial progress in Europe over the past few years, including introducing our fastener lines in the Nordic region and France, consolidating our European management team to create efficiencies, and implementing significant cost-cutting initiatives.\nAs a result, we achieved an operating income margin of 7% in 2020, excluding our SAP costs of approximately $2.5 million.\nWhile this is lower than our original target range of 8% to 9%, we are pleased with the results, which reflect approximately 350 basis points of improvement compared to 2016.\nOur third objective focused on enhancing our working capital management and overall balance sheet discipline.\nSince the beginning of the 2020 plan, we've made progress in this area, primarily through inventory reductions and the implementation of lean principles throughout our operations.\nWe completed a three-phase SKU reduction program, eliminating over 12,000 non-moving or slow-moving items and transitioning our customers to replacement products.\nAdditionally, we conducted rapid improvement events at many of our US production facilities, resulting in efficiency enhancements and improved management of inventory and purchasing practices.\nMoving forward, we remain committed to driving continuous cost management and improved efficiencies through our lean initiatives.\nAligning with our approach, it's vital to strike a balance between inventory acquisitions and cash requirements to uphold our product availability standards and deliver exceptional customer service.\nThe last component of our 2020 strategy aimed to enhance shareholder value by boosting our return on invested capital from 10.5% in 2016 to between 15% and 16% by 2020's end.\nThrough effective operational execution and the implementation of the 2017 US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which reduced our effective tax rate starting in 2018, we exceeded this goal, concluding 2020 with a 20% return on invested capital.\nAdditionally, we continued to distribute capital to our shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases.\nIn 2020, we distributed $116.2 million to our stockholders, comprising $40 million in dividends and $76.2 million in share buybacks.\nSince the 2020 plan's inception, we have returned over 83% of our operational cash flow to shareholders, far surpassing our 50% target. I'm incredibly proud of our achievements over the past three years. By implementing the 2020 plan, we achieved substantial organic growth, streamlined our cost structure to boost company-wide profitability, and enhanced our working capital management and balance sheet position, thereby creating value for all key Simpson stakeholders.\nLet's now briefly review our fourth quarter results and operational initiatives.\nOur fourth quarter consolidated net sales grew 12% year-over-year to $293.9 million, driven by significantly higher volume.\nGross margin increased to 42.1% from 41.9% in the previous year's quarter, primarily due to strong performance in Europe, where we experienced lower material and warehouse costs.\nOur robust gross margin, combined with effective expense management and reduced costs from travel and other restrictions due to COVID-19, led to a 7.8% year-over-year increase in our operating income to $39.5 million and earnings of $0.68 per diluted share.\nThe fourth quarter sales volume increase was mainly attributed to ongoing momentum in the home center distribution channel, which includes both our home centers and co-op customers.\nWe continue to observe a shift in consumer behavior towards home renovations as a result of the pandemic.\nSales from home center distribution channels, where much of our repair and remodel business occurs, improved compared to the prior year period.\nGrowth was supported by our product rollout of connectors, mechanical anchors, and fastener solutions into all 1737 Lowe's stores, completed during the fourth quarter.\nAs a reminder, Lowe's returned as a home center customer beginning in the second quarter of 2020.\nOur sales were further bolstered by strong US housing starts, as we typically experience a multi-month lag in demand from the time of the start. In the fourth quarter, we benefited from robust third quarter 2020 housing starts, which grew over 11% year-over-year.\nMoreover, while we usually see lower seasonal sales in the fourth quarter due to holiday closures and winter conditions, 2020's fourth quarter experienced a very mild winter.\nThis allowed construction activity to continue late into the year, further boosting our net sales.\nRegarding Europe, sales continued to recover well following government-mandated shutdowns of our operations in the UK and France due to COVID-19 in late March.\nSales were aided by strong demand trends and our ability to meet customer needs through effective inventory management practices.\nWe believe our European sales benefited during the fourth quarter as many competitors faced supply chain issues.\nDuring this time, we were able to offer customers essential products to keep up with demand and maintain job site schedules.\nIt's worth noting that while the UK has reimplemented shutdowns due to the recent COVID-19 surge, we have been designated an essential business. All our major production and distribution facilities remain open and operational, with remote work promoted where possible, such as in our corporate offices.\nRegarding SAP implementation, the rollout continued to progress despite travel limitations related to COVID-19.\nIn the fourth quarter, we completed the SAP rollout at our UK branch and Gallatin, Tennessee locations, both of which are now live.\nMost recently, we successfully transitioned our entire Canadian-based sales organization to SAP, thus completing the full SAP rollout in North America, a significant milestone.\nThis year, we will continue working on the SAP transition in our European locations and the rest of the world. We currently anticipate company-wide completion in 2022 and will continue to monitor and update our timeline if circumstances change.\nI'd like to briefly discuss our capital allocation structure.\nWe are grateful to operate as a supplier to other essential businesses with minimal disruptions due to the pandemic.\nAs our business continues to generate strong cash flow, we remain focused on appropriately balancing our growth and stockholder return priorities.\nWe are pleased to be in a position to pay off our line of credit borrowing in full and declare our quarterly dividend, as we have done consistently since 2004.\nWhile COVID-19 pandemic challenges continue to impact the broader economy, we feel confident in the bright future we believe lies ahead for Simpson as we exit 2020.\nWith another quarter of strong year-over-year growth in housing starts, up over 11% in the fourth quarter of 2020, we believe housing will continue to be a key element of economic recovery in the coming years, and we are well-positioned to capitalize on this environment.\nSimultaneously, we continue to pursue our diversification strategy, positioning our business to be less vulnerable to the US housing market through key investments in adjacent products and markets. We also remain focused on growth, including M&A opportunities that would complement our existing product offering, manufacturing footprint, or strengthen our software capabilities.\nOur success in achieving the 2020 plan targets has created a strong foundation for Simpson, successfully positioning our company for long-term sustainable and increasingly profitable growth.\nWe are now ready for our next chapter.\nToday, I'm pleased to announce that on Tuesday, March 23, we plan to host a Virtual Analyst and Investor Day to provide more insight and details about our business strategy for 2021 and beyond.\nAdditional information about this event will be released in the coming days.\nI'm pleased to discuss our fourth quarter financial results with you today.\nNow turning to our results.\nAs Karen highlighted, our consolidated net sales were strong, increasing 12% to $293.9 million.\nWithin the North America segment, net sales increased 9.8% to $249.1 million, primarily due to higher sales volumes in our home center distribution channel, which includes our home center and co-op customers.\nSales volumes were supported by the return of Lowe's along with increased repair and remodel activity.\nOur net sales benefited additionally from alternative distribution channels, which saw increased demand due to new housing construction and renovation activities.\nIn Europe, revenue grew by 24.9% to $41.8 million, primarily due to higher sales volumes in local currencies.\nWood construction products made up 85% of total sales, up from 83%, while concrete construction products accounted for 15%, down from 17% the previous year.\nOverall gross profit rose by 12.4% to $123.7 million, resulting in a stronger fourth quarter gross margin of 42.1% compared to the previous year.\nGross margin improved by 20 basis points, mainly due to reduced material and warehouse expenses, partially offset by increased labor costs.\nIn North America, our gross margin decreased to 43.2% from 43.9%, while in Europe, it increased to 25.3% from 29.9%.\nFor wood products, our fourth quarter gross margin was 41.8%, up from 40.8% in the same quarter last year, while for concrete products, it was 39.6%, down from 43.7%.\nLet's now examine our fourth quarter costs and operating expenses.\nResearch, development, and engineering expenses grew by 10% to $12.9 million, primarily due to increased personnel costs, stock-based compensation, product testing, and cash profit sharing expenses.\nSelling expenses decreased by 1.2% to $27.8 million, owing to reduced travel, entertainment, advertising, and trade show costs, partially offset by higher personnel expenses, cash profit sharing, sales commissions, and stock-based compensation.\nIn North America, selling expenses declined by 2.1%, while in Europe, they remained largely unchanged.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by 10.9% to $43.6 million, mainly due to higher cash profit sharing, stock-based compensation, and software subscription and license costs.\nTotal operating expenses amounted to $84.3 million, an increase of $5.1 million or approximately 6.5%.\nAs a percentage of net sales, total operating expenses were 28.7%, an improvement of 150 basis points compared to 30.2%.\nOur strong top-line performance, improved fourth quarter gross margin, and careful management of costs and operating expenses contributed to a 7.8% increase in consolidated income from operations, reaching $39.5 million compared to $36.6 million.\nIncome from operations in North America decreased by 1.8% to $36.1 million.\nThe fourth quarter of 2019 North American income from operations included a $5.6 million gain from the sale of a selling and distribution facility.\nIn Europe, income from operations grew by 145.8% to $1.3 million, primarily due to increased gross profit.\nOur consolidated operating income margin of 13.4% decreased by approximately 50 basis points.\nThe effective tax rate increased to 25.6% from 22.3% due to the release of foreign valuation allowances in 2019.\nConsequently, net income reached $29.6 million or $0.68 per fully diluted share, compared to $28.1 million or $0.63 per fully diluted share.\nLet's now examine our balance sheet and cash flow.\nOur balance sheet remained robust with sufficient liquidity for daily operations.\nAs of December 31, cash and cash equivalents totaled $274.6 million, an increase of $44.4 million compared to December 31, 2019, after repaying the remaining $75 million on our revolving credit facility during the quarter.\nThe full $300 million on our primary line of credit was available for borrowing as of December 31, 2020.\nOur inventory position of $283.7 million at December 31 increased by $23.6 million from our balance at September 30, as we continue to experience higher levels of construction activity and unprecedented demand during the pandemic.\nWe remain highly selective in our inventory purchases through careful management and purchasing practices while maintaining high levels of customer service and on-time delivery standards.\nDue to improved profitability and effective working capital management, we generated strong cash flow from operations of $77.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2020, an increase of $21.1 million or 37.4%.\nFor the full year of 2020, we generated $207.1 million of cash flow from operations, an increase of nearly $1.5 million.\nWe allocated approximately $17 million for capital expenditures during the fourth quarter.\nFor the entire year of 2020, capital expenditures totaled approximately $37.9 million, aligning with our reduced expectations due to our focus on cash preservation in mid-2020 in response to COVID-19.\nWe were pleased to have distributed $40.4 million in dividends during fiscal 2020, including $10.2 million in the fourth quarter.\nAdditionally, we repurchased about 1.05 million shares of our common stock in 2020 at an average price of $72.33 per share, totaling $76.2 million.\nThis includes approximately 151,000 shares of our common stock repurchased during the fourth quarter at an average price of $89.49 per share, totaling $13.5 million.\nAs our authorization for common stock repurchases expired at year-end, our Board of Directors approved the repurchase of up to $100 million of our common stock on December 16, effective from January 1, 2021 through December 31, 2021.\nFurthermore, on January 22, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per share, payable on April 22, 2021 to stockholders of record as of April 1, 2021.\nBased on current business trends and conditions as of February 8, we are providing guidance for the full year ending December 31, 2021 as follows.\nWe estimate the operating margin to be between 16.5% and 18.5%.\nThe effective tax rate is projected to be between 25% and 26%, including both federal and state income taxes.\nCapital expenditures are estimated to be between $50 million and $55 million, with approximately $10 million to $13 million allocated for maintenance capex.\nAs of today, the extent and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on general economic conditions remain uncertain.\nIt's important to note that potential economic impacts related to COVID-19 on our operations, raw material costs, consumers, suppliers, and vendors may significantly affect our 2021 financial outlook if conditions change substantially from the current environment.\nWe will continue to monitor the impact of COVID-19 on our operations, which were not significantly affected in the fourth quarter of 2020.\nIn conclusion, despite COVID-19-related challenges in the market and ongoing uncertainty, we were very pleased with our fourth quarter financial results and operational performance.\nOur industry-leading position, geographic reach, and diverse product offerings, combined with our strong balance sheet and liquidity, give us confidence in our ability to maintain operational excellence and support current and future demand trends.\nAs mentioned by Karen, we look forward to updating you on our future business strategy for 2021 and beyond during our Virtual Analyst and Investor Day on March 23.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:We'll be reviewing findings that were made public yesterday evening after market close.\nTo access the audio stream, please visit the stewart.com site and locate the conference call link.\nSince these statements are based on anticipated future financial performance rather than established facts, actual outcomes may differ considerably from projections.\nShortly, David will provide a comprehensive breakdown of this quarter's financial outcomes.\nHowever, before that, I want to address Stewart's operational progress to date and our ongoing implementation of long-term objectives.\nTwo years ago, we embarked on a mission at Stewart to become the leading provider of title services.\nWe recognized it would require time, but we were also aware of our valuable brand, robust financial position, and employees eager to contribute and make a difference.\nSince then, we've dealt with the significant effects of COVID-19 as well as an unprecedented real estate market that continues to show strength.\nWhat is our current position in this journey?\nWhat have been the key areas of focus and advancement?\nWe've substantially enhanced our operational capabilities by expanding our presence in key markets, complementing our core business with crucial real estate technology and services, and introducing fresh talent and enthusiasm into a company with 125 years of history.\nI often describe us as a 125-year-old startup.\nInitial targets of achieving double-digit margins have been reached and surpassed, albeit with assistance from a particularly strong market.\nAs David will elaborate, Stewart's operating revenues have increased by nearly $240 million or 40% compared to last year.\nOperating income rose by over $30 million or 55% in a quarter where the Mortgage Bankers Association predicts a 12% year-over-year decrease in purchase originations and a 25% decline in overall mortgage originations.\nTherefore, we believe we are significantly outperforming the market and generating substantial value.\nAt this point in our journey, we can confidently state that much has fundamentally changed and improved, but there is still more to accomplish.\nThrough acquisitions, we have increased our presence in many crucial markets where our previous size limited profitability and hindered efficient daily operations management.\nScale and adaptability are vital in an industry that is both seasonal and cyclical.\nWe expedited our restructuring during a period of high transaction volume.\nWe shuttered offices where we anticipated future challenges.\nWe also entered two markets we believe will be focal points of real estate activity in the future.\nRegarding talent, we are becoming an attractive destination for exceptional individuals.\nHalf of the senior leadership team at Stewart consists of new hires or recently promoted individuals.\nOur bold entrepreneurial initiatives have drawn exceptional talent from various sectors of the real estate industry, not just title operations.\nOur investment, dedication, and adaptability in real estate technology have attracted numerous skilled leaders to our organization.\nThis influx of talent and improvement in our operations will support our long-term growth strategy.\nWe have enhanced our value to customers by simplifying their experience with our services.\nWe've implemented new technologies and services for our larger lending partners, increasing efficiency in both current and future digital markets.\nOur smaller clients appreciate how we simplify their daily operations through our tools, technology, services, and security measures.\nThe security aspect is crucial, as wire fraud has become a significant concern for agents, prompting our partnership with Certified.\nI'd like to leave you with a couple of key points to consider.\nWhile we've benefited from the current robust real estate market, Stewart is focused on building a business that can thrive throughout all market cycles and leverage technology to revolutionize the closing process.\nWe are committed to driving digital innovation to deliver an exceptional closing process now and in the future, and I'm confident our investments have positioned us for ongoing success.\nAlthough we aim for a fully automated and digitized closing process in the future, it's important to recognize that title insurance remains a technology-enhanced but execution-driven business, where title clearing mitigates risk for customers making the biggest purchase of their lives.\nThis fact is of utmost importance.\nWe continue to progress towards our objectives, now one quarter closer to our target.\nDavid will now present the quarterly results.\nDespite entering a typically slower real estate season, market conditions remain strong, driven by demand and favorable interest rates.\nThe commercial sector is showing signs of recovery, particularly in industrial, energy, and multifamily segments.\nSeveral factors could impact future business performance, including government policies, mortgage delinquency rates, ongoing pandemic concerns, rising inflation, and supply chain disruptions.\nIn line with our strategy and Fred's remarks, we're concentrating on areas that will have the most significant and lasting impact on our long-term performance: expanding in key direct markets, improving our agency and commercial operations, broadening our lender services, and enhancing our digital capabilities to improve user experience across all business areas.\nFor Q3 2021, Stewart reported net income of $89 million and diluted earnings per share of $3.26, with total operating revenues of $830 million.\nAdjustments to our Q3 net income were primarily due to a gain related to an acquisition contingent liability adjustment.\nCompared to the previous year, total title revenues for the quarter increased by $205 million or 37%, driven by strong performance in our residential agency and commercial operations.\nThe title division generated $119 million in pre-tax earnings, surpassing last year's quarter by $37 million due to revenue growth and focused management.\nThe segment's pretax margin improved by 90 basis points to 15% compared to the previous year.\nIn our direct title operations, residential revenue grew by $55 million or 23%, driven by an increase in purchase transactions and improved efficiency.\nThe average residential fee per file reached approximately $2,400, a 24% increase from last year, attributed to a higher proportion of purchase transactions.\nDomestic commercial revenue rose by $28 million or 76%, due to increased transaction volume and a higher average fee per file of $15,400, up from $9,700 in the previous year's quarter.\nOverall international revenue increased by $17 million or 49%, mainly due to improved volumes in Canadian operations.\nTotal opened and closed orders in the third quarter decreased by 13% and 3% respectively, primarily due to fewer refinancing transactions, aligning with market trends.\nNevertheless, commercial and purchase closed orders increased by 11% and 8% respectively compared to the third quarter of 2020.\nAgency operations, in line with our direct title business, had a strong quarter with revenues increasing 42% to $402 million from $283 million the previous year.\nThe agency remittance rate for the third quarter was 17.9%, down from 18.2% last year.\nYear-to-date, the remittance rate remained steady at 17.8% for both 2021 and 2020.\nTotal title loss expense increased by $2 million or 7%, primarily due to higher title revenues, partially offset by favorable claims experience.\nTitle loss expense as a percentage of title revenues in the third quarter was 4%, down from 5% in the prior year quarter.\nTotal operating expenses increased primarily in relation to higher revenues.\nEmployee costs as a percentage of operating revenues improved to 24% from 26% last year, while other operating expenses increased to 18% from 17% due to higher pass-through appraisal and service costs.\nExcluding these pass-through costs, our overall other operating expense ratio would have remained similar to last year.\nThe Informative Research transaction closed at the end of September, with the company showing $85 million in run rate revenues and a 15%-plus pre-tax margin.\nOur financial position remains robust, with approximately $585 million in total cash and investments over regulatory requirements, and about $74 million available on our existing credit facility.\nStockholders' equity attributable to Stewart increased to $1.2 billion as of September 30, 2021, with a book value of approximately $45 per share.\nNet cash provided by operations for the third quarter rose to $107 million, up from $91 million in the same quarter last year.\nWe remain thankful for and motivated by our customers and associates, advocating for improved safety and prosperity for all, and confident in our support of real estate markets.\nSummary:

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:I'll now hand things over to Mike.\nLet's begin with an overview of how we're addressing the ongoing COVID-19 situation.\nWe're implementing all required steps to safeguard our employees' wellbeing, including adopting protocols that align with guidelines from health authorities and government agencies to protect our staff and contractors.\nOur dedicated COVID-19 team continuously assesses the changing circumstances and adapts our approach accordingly.\nNow, let's discuss our performance in the third quarter.\nDespite operating at reduced levels, our cokemaking facilities performed admirably.\nAll our operations demonstrated exceptional cost management and achieved results matching our projections, even in the face of challenging market conditions.\nA noteworthy accomplishment for SunCoke this quarter was the two-year extension of our Haverhill II contract with AK Steel, now set to conclude on June 30, 2025.\nThis extension underscores the robustness and longevity of our customer relationships.\nIn our last earnings call, we announced SunCoke's plans to enter the foundry coke market.\nWe're making good progress on the testing, development, and capital investment needed for profitable foundry coke production, and we're enthusiastic about introducing our high-quality product to this new market.\nWe've conducted tests of our foundry coke in Cupolas with several potential clients, yielding promising results.\nWe're now in a strong position to profitably enter the foundry coke market in 2021.\nWe're continuing to work towards our revised 2020 goals and are on track to meet our full-year adjusted EBITDA guidance.\nLet's now examine our third quarter results.\nAs shown on slide four, we reported a diluted loss per share of $0.03 in Q3 2020, compared to a $1.81 loss per share in Q3 2019.\nThe previous year's figure included a $1.94 per share impairment charge related to our logistics goodwill and CMT's long-lived assets. Excluding this non-cash charge, earnings per share decreased by $0.16 quarter-over-quarter, primarily due to reduced volumes across all segments.\nRegarding adjusted EBITDA, we achieved $47.8 million in Q3 2020, down from $66.7 million in Q3 2019.\nAdjusted EBITDA from coke operations fell by $11.8 million compared to the same period last year.\nDomestic sales volumes were roughly 190,000 tons lower than the previous year due to customer cutbacks.\nThe impact of decreased volume was partially mitigated by lower operating expenses.\nThe Logistics segment's Adjusted EBITDA fell by $5.3 million compared to the third quarter of 2019\nCMT and domestic terminals experienced a reduction in throughput volumes of about 1.4 million tons compared to the previous year\nThe fifth slide compares the adjusted EBITDA figures from the third quarters of 2019 and 2020\nAs mentioned in our previous conference call, we collaborated with our coke customers to address their immediate coke requirements in response to a difficult and unprecedented situation\nWe consented to decrease our coke production by roughly 550,000 tons in 2020 in return for extending several coke contracts\nThe majority of this reduction will take place during the third and fourth quarters of 2020\nThis decrease in volume led to lower adjusted EBITDA from coke operations in the third quarter of 2020 compared to the previous year\nEffective cost management partially mitigated the impact of these reduced volumes\nLogistics operations experienced a $5.3 million decrease quarter-over-quarter due to lower volumes and pricing, which was counterbalanced by reduced operating costs\nThe quarter's corporate expenses include approximately $1 million in foundry-related research and development costs\nThese expenses were also affected by period-over-period mark-to-market adjustments in deferred compensation, influenced by fluctuations in the company's stock price\nSlide six presents the performance of Domestic Coke operations\nWe sold 868,000 tons of coke during the quarter\nThe volume relief provided to our customers affected sales volumes across all facilities\nThe adjusted EBITDA per ton for Q3 2020 was about $56, compared to $57 per ton in Q3 2019\nThe decrease in adjusted EBITDA per ton was attributed to lower sales volume but was mostly offset by favorable cost recovery and efficient cost management\nOur plants have been conscientious in reducing costs where possible by managing supplies and services, overtime, contractor usage, postponing capital work, and various other measures\nTransitioning to slide seven\nLogistics adjusted EBITDA for Q3 2020 was $4.3 million, compared to $9.6 million in Q3 2019\nCMT contributed $1.7 million to Q3 2020 adjusted EBITDA, down from $7.4 million in Q3 2019, despite comparable volume\nThe decline in CMT's adjusted EBITDA is primarily due to lower pricing\nThe domestic terminals handled about 2.2 million tons in Q3 2020, down from 3.4 million tons in Q3 2019\nThe decreased activity at domestic logistics hubs was counterbalanced by cost-cutting initiatives, including significant staff reductions.\nLet's proceed to the next presentation slide.\nThe diagram indicates our cash reserves stood at $86 million at the quarter's end.\nDuring the quarter, operational activities generated $74.5 million in cash flow, while we invested $16.5 million in capital expenditures.\nWe reduced our revolving credit facility debt as working capital changes provided cash this quarter.\nWe anticipate a reversal in working capital during the fourth quarter as we accumulate coal stocks for winter and prepare for increased production in 2021.\nFurthermore, we distributed a $0.06 per share dividend, utilizing $5 million in cash, and have announced the third quarter dividend.\nWe set the dividend at a level we believe can be maintained even in challenging market conditions.\nAlthough our Board of Directors makes this decision quarterly, we believe we have sufficient liquidity to sustain this dividend.\nAt the quarter's end, our trailing twelve-month gross leverage ratio was 3.37 times, and our net leverage ratio was 2.98 times.\nWe aim to continue implementing our long-term capital allocation strategy, primarily focusing on reducing gross leverage to three times or below.\nTo achieve this, we bought back $7.5 million face value of SXCP notes in the third quarter and an additional $33.2 million in the fourth quarter.\nLet's conclude with slide nine.\nAs we continue to operate in these unprecedented times, our top priority remains the safety and welfare of our employees and contractors.\nWe will continue to take all necessary measures to ensure they are well-equipped, protected, and able to perform their duties confidently.\nWe remain committed to our core businesses and optimizing our operations, including our logistics assets.\nAs announced last quarter, we've made significant progress in reducing costs and enhancing near-term stability by collaborating with customers to address current market challenges and long-term supply needs.\nWe also continue to maintain our assets to ensure efficient long-term operations, even if short-term activity levels fluctuate.\nWe take pride in our investments, which have created the industry's highest quality assets, and we are committed to fully utilizing and maintaining them.\nLastly, we are confident in our revised financial targets, and our entire organization is focused on achieving these results.\nWe can now open the floor for questions and answers.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:This data is accessible in the Investor Relations portion of the site.\nOn the call, we'll discuss non-GAAP financial metrics when evaluating the company's performance.\nA comparison of these metrics to GAAP financial measures can be found in our call materials.\nSynchrony Financial does not edit or guarantee the accuracy of third-party transcripts of our earnings calls.\nSynchrony's model demonstrated its strength in our Q3 financial results.\nWe expanded our reach to more partners and customers.\nNew accounts increased by 17% to 6.2 million, while average active accounts grew by 5% to 67.2 million in the quarter.\nThis growth is largely due to our effective combination of data-driven insights, smooth customer experiences, and top-tier product offerings, which strongly appeal to customers.\nSynchrony's multi-channel capabilities allow our partners and customers to interact wherever and whenever they prefer, while our diverse financing options and value propositions provide them with flexibility.\nAs we continue to anticipate and meet the needs of our partners and customers, we generate more value and increase usage.\nThis led to an 11% rise in purchase volume per active account and a 16% increase in total purchase volume compared to the previous year in Q3.\nHowever, this strong purchase volume was mostly offset by consistently high payment rates resulting from government stimulus and industry-wide forbearance measures, leading to a modest 2% growth in loans, including those held for sale.\nThe net interest margin of 15.45% was 165 basis points higher than last year, mainly due to reduced excess liquidity.\nOperating costs decreased by 10% year-over-year and 7% year-to-date as our cost-cutting initiatives progress as planned.\nWe're on track to reduce our expense base by about $210 million by year-end while continuing to invest in our business.\nThe efficiency ratio for the quarter was 38.7%, largely unchanged from last year.\nCredit performance remained strong.\nNet charge-offs were 2.18% for Q3, a decrease of 224 basis points from the previous year.\nNet earnings were $1.1 billion or $2 per diluted share, including a $0.33 benefit from the reserve release related to reclassifying the Gap portfolio as held for sale.\nRegarding our balance sheet, deposits decreased by $3 billion or 5% compared to last year, reflecting our retail deposit rate actions to manage excess liquidity.\nDeposits made up 82% of our funding mix at quarter-end, a slight increase from last year due to debt retirement.\nDuring the quarter, we returned $1.4 billion in capital through $1.3 billion in share repurchases and $124 million in common stock dividends.\nWe continue to reinvest in our business.\nAs highlighted at our recent Investor Day, our ability to stay agile and adapt to the changing consumer finance landscape is driven by ongoing investment in our product suite and innovative digital capabilities.\nOver the past decade, the introduction of digital wallets, point-of-sale financing, and a wider range of installment options has shown the importance of diversity, accessibility, and utility in both products and customer experience.\nSynchrony has continuously evolved by adding new financing options, enhancing our technology platform, and expanding our channels and distribution networks to reach and serve more partners and customers in sustainable ways that create greater value for all.\nIn addition to launching new products and partner programs, we're focusing on innovative ways to scale the distribution of our product suite.\nWe recently announced an expanded strategic partnership with Fiserv, allowing small businesses to access Synchrony products and services and accept private label credit card payments through Fiserv's Clover point-of-sale and business management platform.\nThis will enable accelerated growth for small businesses, helping merchants attract more customers and generate more revenue by offering our customers greater flexibility and choice in making purchases.\nWe'll also explore additional opportunities to cross-sell Synchrony products to existing Clover merchants.\nThis strategic partnership deepens Synchrony's ecosystem and supports our growth strategy to expand and accelerate innovative product offerings through additional distribution channels.\nIt builds on our momentum to bring our products to merchants faster and leverages Synchrony's leadership in financing, analytics, and services.\nWe're excited to use Clover's point-of-sale innovations to continue transforming the way people purchase while helping merchants grow.\nAs we and our partners strive to provide more comprehensive customer access to financial products and resources, we're excited to expand our partnership with PayPal.\nAs announced in late September, Synchrony will launch PayPal Savings, a new PayPal-branded savings account.\nThis unique opportunity will allow us to expand the distribution of our savings product to a specific set of customers with features and functionality within the PayPal app, delivering an enhanced customer experience while also diversifying our deposit base at an attractively low acquisition cost.\nIn addition to expanding our product suite and distribution network, we also aim to enhance partner and customer engagement through customized value propositions and omnichannel capabilities.\nWe recently launched two industry-first retail health and wellness credit cards: the myWalgreens Mastercard and myWalgreens private label credit card, which reward customers with savings on future health and wellness purchases.\nMyWalgreens credit cardholders can earn 10% Walgreens cash rewards on eligible Walgreens branded products and 5% Walgreens cash rewards on other eligible brands and pharmacy purchases.\nMyWalgreens Mastercard holders can also earn 3% Walgreens cash rewards on eligible grocery and health and wellness purchases elsewhere, including healthcare providers, and 1% Walgreens cash rewards on eligible purchases anywhere Mastercard credit cards are accepted.\nIn a world where consumers are increasingly responsible for a larger share of their health-related costs, we believe these value propositions will drive considerable value while providing greater financing flexibility for health-related needs and enhancing loyalty over time.\nSynchrony's digital capabilities allow us to seamlessly engage with customers wherever they are.\nWe have deep digital integration across Walgreens' web, mobile, and native app channels, enabling customers to apply and instantly buy through all these channels.\nWe've launched frictionless customer experiences, leveraging technology capabilities like QR codes, quick screen (a real-time pre-screen of one), customer-initiated pre-qualification, a direct-to-device in-store application process, card servicing integrated seamlessly into the Walgreens app, and API integration with the myWalgreens loyalty program.\nAlthough it's still early, initial data suggests that both the value proposition and dynamic customer experience we've achieved with Walgreens are resonating well with cardholders, driving spend both inside and outside of Walgreens in categories such as grocery, health, and wellness.\nBy empowering our partners and customers with best-in-class wallet optionality and compelling outcomes, Synchrony is increasingly well-positioned as the partner of choice.\nWith over 65 million active accounts, Synchrony has market-leading reach and deep, diverse lending insights that enable us to better anticipate customer needs and determine which financing options will optimize utilization and drive lifetime value.\nWhether it's our dual, co-branded and private label credit cards, our various SetPay installment products, or our Synchrony Mastercard, we have a deep understanding of when, why, and how customers seek financing solutions for their everyday purchases.\nWe're particularly excited about the opportunity we see for our Synchrony Mastercard, which allows us to tap into the $500 billion general purpose credit card market.\nWe're taking a measured approach to growth, but by leveraging our scale and underwriting expertise, we've been able to identify better-performing customer segments, acquire more customers at lower CPAs, and refine our channel strategy over the past two years.\nPresently, Synchrony Mastercard provides diverse value offerings, which we combine with our pricing approach to broaden our customer base and enhance conversion rates, while also offering excellent digital functionality through dApply, Apple Wallet integration, and our mobile application.\nCustomers can view their various banking products, including money market and high-yield savings accounts, as well as credit card balances and transaction histories.\nThis combination of value and seamless digital experience strongly appeals to our customers, resulting in a 36% increase in purchase volume compared to the same period in 2019.\nWe're also noticing increased engagement with the product and brand, as spending per active account has risen by 40% compared to 2019.\nWe're very enthusiastic about our Synchrony Mastercard.\nIt's a crucial component of our product suite strategy that we believe will help us capture a larger share of customers' primary spending and should drive scalable growth and above-average returns for our business in the long run.\nSynchrony's third quarter financial performance showed widespread strength across our operations, characterized by a double-digit increase in purchase volume and continued loan growth, a significant improvement in our net interest margin, historically low losses and delinquencies, and ongoing cost management.\nThese results combined to produce $1.1 billion in net earnings or $2 per diluted share, a 4.9% return on average assets, and a 40.1% return on tangible common equity.\nThese outcomes clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of Synchrony's unique business model, which builds on our extensive expertise in consumer lending and utilizes advanced digital capabilities through our comprehensive multi-product suite to reach and serve a wide and diverse range of partners and customers.\nExamining our third quarter performance more closely, starting with purchase volume, which grew 16% compared to last year and 16% compared to 2019 excluding Walmart, indicates clear widespread strength in consumer demand.\nThis is also reflected in our purchase volume per account, which rose 11% compared to last year.\nDual card and co-branded cards made up 40% of the purchase volume in the third quarter and increased 29% from the previous year.\nIn terms of loan receivables, excluding the impact of reclassifying the Gap portfolio as held for sale, dual and co-branded cards accounted for 24% of the portfolio and grew 4% from the previous year.\nThe number of average active accounts increased 5% compared to last year, and new accounts rose 17%, totaling over 6 million new accounts in the third quarter and more than 17.5 million new accounts overall.\nIn late August, we reached an agreement to sell the Gap portfolio, resulting in the reclassification of $3.5 billion of loan receivables as held for sale, which reduced our ending loan receivables balance.\nExcluding the impact of this reclassification, loan receivables would have grown by 2% compared to the previous year, as the period's strong purchase volume growth was largely offset by a consistently high payment rate.\nThe payment rate for the third quarter was approximately 200 basis points higher compared to last year.\nInterest and fees on loans grew 2% compared to last year, reflecting similar growth in average loan receivables.\nNet interest income was 6% higher than last year, primarily due to a decrease in interest expense resulting from lower benchmark rates.\nRSAs were $1.3 billion in the third quarter and 6.38% of average receivables.\nThe $367 million year-over-year increase mainly reflected the impact of lower provision for credit losses and continued strong program performance, including growth and improvement in net interest income.\nTo provide context, remember that RSAs are designed to align interests between ourselves and each of our partners.\nThis means driving growth in attractive risk-adjusted returns and enhancing program profitability.\nThis allows each partner to share in the program's performance, so when profitability expands, our partners benefit from that upside.\nWhen considering the combined $1.4 billion year-over-year improvement in net interest income, net losses, and the reserve change, we shared $367 million of that through the RSA.\nRegarding our credit performance, the provision for losses was $25 million.\nThis quarter's provision included a reserve release of $407 million, which incorporated our continued strength in credit performance, an optimistic macroeconomic environment, and the impact of reclassifying our Gap portfolio loan receivables as held for sale.\nThis resulted in a reserve reduction of approximately $247 million.\nOther income decreased by $37 million, generally reflecting higher loyalty program costs due to increased purchase volume during the quarter.\nOther expenses decreased by $106 million compared to the previous year.\nAs you may recall, last year we recognized an $89 million restructuring charge, and we continue to see benefits from lower operational losses.\nMoving to our platform results, we observed widespread purchase volume growth across all five platforms, indicating strong consumer demand.\nOur Home & Auto, Diversified & Value, Digital, and Health & Wellness platforms each experienced double-digit year-over-year growth in purchase volume.\nThe 10% year-over-year increase in Home & Auto was generally driven by strong retailer performance across almost all verticals, while purchase volume in Diversified & Value increased 25%, reflecting the continued return to in-person retail experiences.\nIn Digital, the 21% increase was due to widespread growth across our partners coupled with growth in our new programs with Verizon and Venmo.\nIn Health & Wellness, the 10% growth in purchase volume primarily reflected consumers feeling more comfortable with the environment and undergoing planned procedures.\nMeanwhile, purchase volume grew a more modest 2% in Lifestyle, reflecting widespread growth across the platform but facing a tough comparison to last year's strong growth in power sports.\nLoan receivable growth trends by platform generally showed modest growth rates compared to the previous year, as higher purchase volume was largely offset by elevated payment rates.\nThe exception was in our Diversified & Value platform, which was impacted by store closures in 2020.\nAverage active account trends varied by platform, increasing by as much as 10% in Diversified & Value and 7% in Digital, while Home & Auto and Health & Wellness average active accounts were generally flat.\nThe active account growth in Diversified & Value largely reflected the return to in-store retail experiences.\nDigital active accounts increased compared to the previous year due to greater engagement across our existing customer base as well as the impact of recent program launches.\nInterest and fee trends generally improved across the platform, with the exception of Diversified & Value, which decreased due to lower receivables.\nMoving on to net interest income and margin trends, the accumulated savings by consumers resulting from stimulus, forbearance, and lower discretionary spending continued to impact payment rates during the third quarter.\nPayment rates were approximately 260 basis points higher than our five-year historical average.\nHowever, we've started to see some signs of moderation in certain groups, as the payment rate was about 200 basis points higher year-over-year compared to almost 300 basis points higher in the year-over-year comparison for the second quarter.\nWe expect the payment rate to gradually normalize as consumer spending remains robust, excess savings peak, and widespread forbearance diminishes.\nInterest and fees increased approximately 2% in the third quarter, reflecting average loan receivable growth.\nNet interest income rose 6% from last year, reflecting the year-over-year improvement in interest and fees as well as lower interest expenses for the period.\nThe net interest margin was 15.45% compared to last year's margin of 13.8%, a 165 basis point improvement year-over-year driven by the mix of interest-earning assets and favorable interest-bearing liabilities costs.\nThe proportion of loan receivables as a percentage of total earning assets rose by 550 basis points from 78.3% to 83.8% due to reduced liquidity held during the quarter\nThis led to a 106 basis point increase in our net interest margin\nThe cost of interest-bearing liabilities was 1.31%, a 59 basis point improvement year-over-year mainly because of lower benchmark rates and changes in funding mix\nThis resulted in a 51 basis point rise in our net interest margin\nThe yield on loan receivables was 19.59%, a 10 basis point improvement compared to the previous year\nThis caused an 8 basis point enhancement in our net interest margin\nI will now discuss our key credit trends on Slide 10\nLet's first examine our delinquency trends, where increased payment rates have continued to drive year-over-year improvements\nOur 30-plus day delinquency rate was 2.42% compared to 2.67% last year\nOur 90-plus day delinquency rate was 1.05% compared to 1.24% last year\nIt's worth noting that if we remove the impact of the Gap program from the third quarters of this year and last year, the 30-plus day delinquency metric would have decreased by about 40 basis points instead of 25 basis points, and the 90-plus day metric would have dropped by about 25 basis points instead of 19 basis points\nRegarding our portfolio's loss performance, our net charge-off rate was 2.18% compared to 4.42% last year\nThis year-over-year improvement was mainly driven by the strong delinquency trends we've experienced\nOur allowance for credit losses as a percentage of loan receivables was 11.28%\nLet's move to Slide 11 to discuss expenses\nOverall expenses decreased by $106 million or 10% from last year to $961 million, primarily reflecting the impact of the previous year's restructuring charge of $89 million and lower operational losses\nThe efficiency ratio for the third quarter was 38.7% compared to 39.7% last year\nThis metric remains elevated compared to our historical average due to lower revenue resulting from the impact of higher payment rates and lower average receivables\nWe continue to maintain a disciplined focus on cost containment while making strategic investments in our business to enhance our competitive advantage and create long-term value for shareholders\nMoving to Slide 12, given the reduction in loan receivables in 2020 and early 2021, along with the strength of our deposit platform, we continue to maintain a higher level of liquidity\nWhile we believe it's prudent to keep a higher liquidity level during uncertain and volatile periods, we continue to actively manage our funding profile to mitigate excess liquidity and optimize our funding structure\nAs a result of this strategy, there was a shift in our funding mix during the third quarter\nOur deposits declined by $3.2 billion from last year and our securitized and unsecured funding sources decreased by $3 billion\nThis resulted in deposits comprising 82% of our funding, compared to 80% last year, with securitized and unsecured funding each making up 9% of our funding sources at quarter-end\nTotal liquidity including undrawn credit facilities was $18.4 billion, which equated to 20% of our total assets, down from 28% last year\nBefore I provide details on our capital position, it should be noted that we chose to take advantage of the transition rules issued by the joint federal banking agencies, which has two main benefits\nFirst, it delays the effect of the CECL transition adjustment for an additional two years\nSecond, it allows for a portion of the current period provisioning to be deferred and amortized with the transition adjustment\nUnder this framework, we ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 17.1% under the CECL transition rules, 130 basis points above last year's level of 15.8%\nThe Tier 1 capital ratio was 18% under the CECL transition rules compared to 16.7% last year\nThe total capital ratio increased 120 basis points to 19.3% and the Tier 1 capital plus reserves ratio on a fully phased-in basis decreased to 26.6% compared to 27.3% last year\nDuring the quarter, we returned $1.4 billion to shareholders, which included $1.3 billion in share repurchases and $124 million in common stock dividends\nOur business generates strong returns and substantial capital due to our commitment to drive growth at appropriate risk-adjusted returns, the scalability of our technology platform, and our ongoing cost discipline\nWe will continue to take an opportunistic approach to returning our excess capital to shareholders as our business performance and market conditions allow, subject to our capital plan and any regulatory restrictions\nWhile there are several external variables that are difficult to predict precisely, we generally expect the third quarter's key operating trends to remain stable in the fourth quarter\nOur forecast is based on a stable and improving macroeconomic environment and the pandemic continuing to be largely under control\nWe anticipate strong consumer demand through the holiday season to support continued strength in purchase volume\nThis strength, partially offset by continued elevation in payment rates, should lead to modest growth in receivables\nOur net interest margin will likely be consistent with the third quarter of 2021\nOur provision for credit losses will continue to reflect the impact of asset growth, credit performance, and macroeconomic factors, as well as continued reserve reductions related to the Gap portfolio\nAs credit losses begin to normalize, we expect the RSA as a percentage of average loan receivables to start moderating\nLastly, regarding our operating expenses, we expect the acceleration in purchase volume to contribute to a slight sequential increase in absolute dollars for the fourth quarter\nHowever, we still anticipate full-year operating expenses to be lower compared to 2020\nAs we conclude the year and look to the future, we're excited about the opportunities we see to continue driving strong financial results and shareholder value\nWe are well-positioned to execute on the strategy we outlined during our Investor Day and drive sustainable growth and attractive risk-adjusted returns simply by continuing to leverage our inherent core strengths, the breadth and depth of our business model, the scalability of our innovative digital capabilities, and customer lifetime value expansion we drive through our diversified product suite and powerful value propositions\nI'm truly proud of the results that we as a team continue to deliver for Synchrony's partners, customers, and stakeholders\nWe have a unique understanding of the wide range of needs that our partners and customers seek to address at any given time, and our differentiated approach to addressing those needs enables us to deliver solutions and experiences that deeply resonate\nWhether it's through the optionality embedded within our diverse product suite and customized value propositions or the many ways in which we power the connection between our partners and customers, Synchrony continues to reach, engage, and serve more customers and drive greater, more sustainable outcomes for our stakeholders\nWe will now begin the Q&A session\nTo accommodate as many participants as possible, I'd like to ask the participants to please limit themselves to one primary and one follow-up question\nIf you have additional questions, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call\nOperator, please start the Q&A session\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Check our website at transdigm.com for additional presentation materials and call replay details.\nDuring this call, we will reference non-GAAP financial metrics including EBITDA as defined, adjusted net income, and adjusted earnings per share.\nI'll begin with a brief overview of our strategy and quarterly performance before handing over to Kevin and Mike for more in-depth analysis.\nWe stand out in the industry for maintaining a consistent strategy and focus on creating shareholder value throughout all stages of the aerospace cycle, in both good and challenging times.\nLet me summarize the key reasons we believe this to be true.\nProprietary products generate about 90% of our sales, with over 75% coming from products where we are the sole supplier.\nThe majority of our EBITDA is derived from aftermarket revenues, which typically offer higher margins and greater stability during downturns over extended periods.\nWe adhere to a consistent long-term strategy.\nOur focus is on owning and managing proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket potential.\nWe employ a straightforward, proven value-based operational approach.\nOur organization is decentralized with a unique compensation structure aligned closely with shareholder interests.\nWe target acquisitions that fit our strategy and offer potential for private equity-like returns.\nOur capital structure and allocation strategy are integral to our value creation approach.\nWe aim to provide our shareholders with private equity-like returns combined with public market liquidity.\nThis requires meticulous attention to value creation details and careful capital allocation.\nThe commercial aerospace market remains challenging, but we're seeing some positive signs.\nWe observed another significant sequential increase in commercial aftermarket bookings during Q2, marking the second consecutive quarter of substantial growth.\nThe air travel recovery, which concerned us last quarter, appears somewhat improved, though still inconsistent, potentially delaying the ramp-up by a quarter or so.\nWe've prioritized two key operational areas during this downturn that we can somewhat control: tight cost management, which we believe is well-handled, and ensuring substantial liquidity, which also seems secure.\nBarring any major disruptions or shutdowns, we should emerge from this situation with considerable financial flexibility.\nWe continue to explore potential M&A opportunities and remain attentive to our capital allocation.\nBoth M&A activity and capital markets are challenging to predict, particularly in the current climate.\nIn Q2, we acquired the Cobham Aero Connectivity business for an enterprise value of $965 million.\nRegarding divestitures, we've recently signed agreements to sell three additional, less proprietary and primarily defense-focused businesses for approximately $240 million.\nThese businesses collectively generate revenues of about $180 million with EBITDA margins in the low 20% range.\nWe expect to receive all proceeds in Q3.\nWe are currently considering the sale of one more primarily defense-oriented business.\nAt present, I don't anticipate making any significant dividend payments or share repurchases for the next three to four quarters, or at least until the commercial market shows stronger signs of recovery and our leverage stabilizes, but we'll continue to monitor the situation and adjust our approach if necessary.\nWe believe we're in the best possible position given the current circumstances and will remain vigilant, ready to respond to market developments as they occur.\nNow, I'll hand over to Kevin to review our performance.\nI'll begin with my usual overview of our quarterly results by key market and business profitability, followed by comments on recent acquisition activity and our fiscal 2021 outlook.\nOur Q2 fiscal 2021 performance continued to be significantly impacted by reduced travel demand due to the pandemic.\nHowever, the commercial aerospace industry has shown signs of recovery in recent months, driven by COVID-19 vaccine distribution and increasing air traffic, particularly in certain domestic markets.\nOur business experienced another quarter of sequential improvement in commercial aftermarket revenues, with total commercial aftermarket revenues up 12% compared to Q1.\nI'm pleased to report that we continued to sequentially expand our EBITDA as defined margin, thanks to careful cost structure management and adherence to our operating strategy in this challenging commercial environment.\nLet's review our revenue by market category.\nFor the remainder of the call, I'll provide commentary on a pro forma basis, comparing to the prior-year period in 2020 as if we owned the same mix of businesses in both periods.\nThis market discussion now includes the recent Cobham Aero Connectivity acquisition and excludes the impact of any divestitures completed by the end of Q2.\nIn the business sector, which typically accounts for nearly 65% of our earnings, we'll divide our analysis into original equipment manufacturers and aftermarket segments.\nOur overall commercial OEM market earnings decreased by about 43% in the second quarter compared to the same period last year.\nWe anticipate that demand for our commercial OEM products will remain significantly lower throughout the latter half of 2021 due to decreased OEM production rates and airlines postponing or canceling new aircraft orders.\nThe long-term outlook for the commercial aerospace industry is uncertain and continually changing.\nWe expect a suppressed commercial OEM end market for an indefinite period compared to pre-pandemic levels.\nNevertheless, recent statements from Airbus regarding potential A320 production increases in 2022 and beyond are quite promising.\nOn a brighter note, second quarter orders showed strong sequential growth of over 20% compared to first quarter orders and significantly exceeded sales.\nAs we noted in our previous report, the improvement in orders we're observing likely indicates a slowdown in OEM inventory reduction.\nShifting our focus to our commercial aftermarket business discussion.\nOverall commercial aftermarket revenues fell by roughly 39% in the second quarter compared to the same quarter last year.\nThis quarterly decrease was mainly caused by reduced demand in our passenger and interior submarkets.\nHowever, our commercial transport freight market experienced slight growth, partially offsetting this decline.\nTo reiterate, sequentially, total commercial aftermarket revenues grew by approximately 12% in the second quarter, another positive indicator.\nCommercial aftermarket orders were still lower this quarter compared to the same period last year.\nHowever, the decline in orders was less severe than the observed decrease in flight traffic, with freight and business jet orders continuing to show improvement.\nSecond quarter orders sequentially improved by almost 30% and significantly outpaced sales.\nThis is likely due to a slowdown in airline inventory reduction, increased flight activity, and future planning.\nTo highlight a few key considerations, global revenue passenger miles remain low, though they have bottomed out and are now recovering.\nIATA's most recent forecast predicts that calendar year 2021 revenue passenger miles will be 57% below 2019 levels, but we are cautiously optimistic.\nThere was an increase in domestic air travel in March and April, and airlines are seeing strong bookings that will drive summer flight schedules.\nSome airlines have already announced domestic wide-body routes to meet the expected demand this summer.\nIATA predicts a strong second half of calendar year 2021 with a rebound in domestic travel in the U.S. returning to 2019 levels of revenue passenger miles and China exceeding that level.\nThere is also potential for more international travel as governments consider revising travel restrictions.\nRegarding cargo demand, this was weaker before the COVID-19 crisis as freight tonne kilometers (FTKs) declined from the peak in 2017.\nHowever, a reduction in passenger belly cargo capacity and an increase in e-commerce have helped cargo operations recover more quickly than commercial travel.\nBusiness jet usage data has shown that activity in certain regions has returned to pre-pandemic levels or better.\nThis is currently due to personal and leisure travel rather than business travel.\nIt remains uncertain whether business jet usage will continue to grow, but current trends are encouraging.\nWe believe there is a global pent-up demand for travel.\nWe see evidence of this demand through the recovery in domestic travel, particularly in the U.S. and China, and the optimism of airlines for the summer season.\nDomestic travel is currently benefiting from international travel restrictions and could compensate for some lost international travel in the market.\nEventually, with vaccine distribution and the lifting of travel restrictions, passenger demand worldwide will increase.\nHistorically, personal travel has accounted for the largest percentage of revenue passenger miles.\nForecasts still indicate a more significant increase in personal travel in the latter half of this calendar year, followed later by business travel, and we are hopeful this will be the case.\nLet me now discuss our defense market, which traditionally accounts for 35% or less of our total revenue.\nThe defense market revenue, which includes both OEM and aftermarket revenues, increased by approximately 8% in the second quarter compared to the same period last year.\nOur defense order book remains robust, and we continue to expect our defense business to grow throughout the remainder of the year.\nTurning now to profitability.\nI will primarily discuss our operating performance or EBITDA as defined.\nEBITDA as defined of about $519 million for the second quarter was down 23% compared to the same quarter last year.\nEBITDA as defined margin in the quarter was approximately 43.5%.\nWe were able to improve our EBITDA as defined margin by nearly 100 basis points sequentially despite the acquisition dilution from the recent Cobham purchase of about 100 basis points as well.\nI'll provide a brief update on our recent acquisition.\nThe integration of Cobham is progressing smoothly under the guidance of our experienced EVP, Joel Reiss.\nWe've owned Cobham for just over four months and are satisfied with the purchase so far.\nCobham has been divided into two operational divisions: Canyon AeroConnect in Prescott, Arizona, and Chelton Limited in Marlow, U.K. Two seasoned TransDigm presidents are overseeing the integration of these divisions.\nLet's discuss our projections for 2021.\nWe're not yet ready to provide official fiscal 2021 sales EBITDA and net income guidance at this time.\nWe'll resume providing guidance when we have a clearer view of the future.\nLike most aerospace suppliers, we're optimistic about a significant increase in activity during the second half of the calendar year.\nCurrently, we're encouraged by the recovery in our commercial OEM and aftermarket orders in the first half of our fiscal year, as well as the improvement in our commercial aftermarket revenues.\nRegarding the defense market and our previous comments on defense revenue growth from the Q4 and Q1 earnings calls, we now anticipate defense revenue growth in the mid-single-digit percentage range for fiscal 2021 compared to the previous year.\nOur earlier expectation for fiscal 2021 defense revenue growth was low to mid-single-digit growth.\nFurthermore, due to the ongoing uncertainty in commercial market channels and in line with our previous statements, we are not providing an expected dollar range for fiscal 2021 EBITDA as defined.\nWe anticipate a steady increase in commercial aftermarket revenue going forward and expect full-year fiscal 2021 EBITDA margin to be approximately 44%, which may fluctuate depending on the pace of commercial aftermarket recovery.\nThis includes a dilutive effect on our EBITDA margin from the Cobham Aero Connectivity acquisition.\nMike will provide details on other fiscal 2021 financial assumptions and updates.\nTo conclude, I'm pleased with the company's performance during this challenging period for the commercial aerospace industry and our commitment to creating value for our stakeholders.\nThe commercial aerospace market recovery is underway, and current trends are promising.\nThere's still uncertainty about the speed of recovery, but our team remains focused on controlling what we can.\nWe're closely monitoring ongoing developments in the commercial aerospace industry and ensuring we're prepared to meet demand as it returns.\nWe're looking forward to the second half of 2021 and expect our consistent strategy to continue delivering the value you've come to expect from us.\nI'll quickly address a few additional financial matters for the quarter and the full fiscal year.\nFor the quarter, organic growth was negative 20%, due to declines in our commercial end markets, despite healthy defense growth.\nOur tax expectations for the full year remain unchanged, with GAAP cash and adjusted rates expected to be in the 18% to 22% range.\nRegarding tax rates beyond FY '21, we're monitoring potential changes in the U.S. tax code under the new administration and will provide guidance on future rate expectations once any legislation is finalized.\nWe now expect the full-year interest expense to be $1.06 billion, reduced from prior guidance, primarily due to refinancing activities completed this year.\nRegarding cash and liquidity, we had another quarter of positive free cash flow.\nFree cash flow, which we define as EBITDA less cash interest payments, cash capex, and cash taxes, was approximately $146 million.\nFor the full fiscal year, we expect to continue generating positive free cash flow as we define it.\nIn line with our November guidance, we still expect this amount to be around $800 million, possibly slightly better, for our fiscal '21.\nWe ended the second quarter with $4.1 billion in cash, down from $4.9 billion at the end of last quarter.\nNote that last quarter's $4.9 billion balance was before the Cobham acquisition, which closed on January 5 for an enterprise value of $965 million.\nAccounting for this acquisition, our Q2 net debt-to-LTM-EBITDA ratio was 8.2 times.\nWith our last pre-COVID quarter now out of the LTM EBITDA calculation, we believe the net debt-to-EBITDA ratio as of our second quarter end is at or very close to its peak.\nIn subsequent quarters, it should either remain relatively stable or, more likely, start to show gradual improvement as our commercial end markets recover.\nFrom an overall cash liquidity and balance sheet perspective, we believe we're in a good position and well-prepared to withstand the current depressed commercial environment for an extended period.\nLastly, I'd like to provide a brief update on our ongoing U.S. DoD IG audit.\nWe've been actively engaged with the IG office, with some fluctuations, and continue to work through the audit process.\nBased on our assessment and what we've observed, this ongoing audit appears to be similar in scope to our previous audits.\nWhile it's difficult to predict exactly when a final report will be issued publicly, we anticipate this might occur sometime during Q3 or Q4 of our fiscal '21.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:During this call, management will reference estimated COVID-19 impacts on Q2 2020 results and discuss July business performance.\nManagement is sharing these insights to provide additional context, but may not continue this practice in future quarters.\nI'm glad to be speaking with you today.\nI want to acknowledge our Teleflex employees globally for their extraordinary efforts during these challenging times to ensure our products reach those who need them most.\nRegarding our Q2 results, given the pandemic's escalation, we're pleased with our performance as it exceeded our expectations and showed improving trends in areas most affected by procedure postponements.\nQ2 revenue was $567 million, down 12% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, with COVID-19 causing an estimated 20% negative impact.\nExcluding COVID effects, we estimate underlying growth of about 8% constant currency, near the high end of our initial 2020 guidance range.\nOur adjusted EPS of $1.93 also significantly surpassed our expectations, reflecting procedure recovery and careful expense management.\nWe've initiated a workforce reduction plan to enhance long-term profitability, primarily targeting EMEA sales and marketing and OEM manufacturing.\nQ2 revenue declined 12% constant currency and 13.1% as reported, mainly due to COVID-19's estimated $144 million impact across several categories, partially offset by $14 million in higher vascular access and other product demand.\nAdjusted gross and operating margins were 53.9% and 21.8%, down 380 and 340 basis points respectively, due to lower volumes and unfavorable mix, partially mitigated by cost containment efforts.\nWhile revenue and profitability declined year-over-year, our overall financial performance demonstrates our diversified portfolio's resilience.\nCOVID-19 negatively impacted Interventional Urology, Surgical, Interventional Access, Anesthesia and OEM revenues, somewhat offset by tailwinds in Vascular Access and other categories.\nWe saw encouraging sequential improvements in May and June for the most affected businesses after a difficult April.\nDespite improving trends into July, we remain cautious due to renewed pressure on hospital capacity in some areas and are not reinstating 2020 guidance at this time.\nAmericas revenue declined 16% to $312.5 million, with growth in vascular access and respiratory products outweighed by other declines.\nEMEA revenue fell 8% to $131.6 million, with similar trends to the Americas.\nAsia revenue decreased 7.8% to $67.1 million.\nOEM revenue declined 0.7% constant currency to $55.8 million, reflecting lagged COVID-19 impacts on customer orders for non-emergent procedure products.\nThe acquisition of HPC is progressing well with integration efforts, and the business is performing satisfactorily under our management.\nWe will now examine our revenue by global product categories.\nComments on global product category growth will be based on constant currency, in line with our reportable segments discussion.\nWe'll begin with Vascular Access.\nQ2 revenues rose 8.8% to $164.9 million, driven by growth in our central venous catheter and EZ-IO products.\nWe believe COVID-19 boosted our vascular products' growth rates by about 5% in the second quarter.\nNext is Interventional Access.\nRevenue for the second quarter was $82.6 million, a 20.3% decrease from the previous year.\nThe decline was primarily due to COVID-19-related postponements of certain non-emergency procedures.\nWe estimate underlying growth was in the mid-single digits, after accounting for an approximate 24% COVID-19 impact.\nQ2 revenues were $64.9 million, a 23% decrease from the previous year.\nThe revenue drop was caused by reduced sales of laryngeal masks and regional anesthesia products.\nWe estimate COVID-19 had a negative impact of about 22% in the quarter.\nRevenue fell by 28.4% to $67.3 million, primarily due to lower sales of our ligation portfolio and instruments.\nWe estimate a substantial 30% impact from COVID-19 during Q2.\nHowever, we've observed monthly improvements since the April low point.\nNext is Interventional Urology.\nQ2 revenue decreased 40.9% to $40.1 million.\nWe estimate a COVID-19-related impact of approximately $58 million during Q2.\nThis product line was the most affected by the cancellation of elective procedures in our portfolio.\nHowever, as the UroLift procedure is typically performed in outpatient settings, we anticipated it would be among the first procedures to resume as the U.S. reopened, which has been confirmed by sequential improvements from April to May, May to June, and June into July.\nLastly, our other category, comprising respiratory and urology care products, grew 5.4% to $91.4 million.\nWe believe the quarter's growth was largely due to increased demand for certain humidification and breathing products related to COVID-19.\nExcluding the estimated COVID-19 benefit, we believe the other category would have shown a slight decline compared to the same period last year.\nThis concludes my remarks on second quarter revenue performance.\nMoving on to clinical and commercial updates.\nOur clinical evidence for UroLift expanded in the second quarter with data from two studies presented at the AUA 2020 Virtual Science Event and another study published in the Canadian Journal of Urology.\nThe first AUA 2020 study was a meta-analysis comparing sexual function in patients treated with UroLift versus medical therapy, while the second study analyzed patient outcomes from the Real World Retrospective study compared to the L.I.F.T. pivotal trial and P.U.L.S.A.R. urinary retention trial.\nThe first study compared sexual function outcomes in 849 sexually active men receiving daily treatments with alpha blockers or 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors to 190 men from UroLift System clinical studies at 12, 24, 36, and 48 months.\nThe analysis showed that UroLift patients experienced significant improvements in ejaculatory function, erectile function, and overall sexual satisfaction, while medical therapies did not improve these functions and sometimes reduced them.\nThe second study revealed similar IPSS scores and safety profiles among non-urinary retention and urinary retention patients treated with UroLift in both real-world and controlled studies.\nMost retention patients became catheter independent by the study's end.\nA study published in the Canadian Journal of Urology compared patient experiences with UroLift to those treated with steam injection tissue ablation.\nEarly postoperative results favored UroLift, showing better sexual function outcomes, less interference with daily activities, and higher patient satisfaction.\nWe continue to expand our clinical evidence, which should encourage adoption of UroLift as the standard of care for minimally invasive BPH treatment in a large global market.\nRegarding commercial updates, we received FDA clearance for the UroLift Advanced Tissue Control (ATC) system, designed to optimize UroLift for treating obstructive median lobe.\nWe plan to test market acceptance for this product in late 2020.\nAlthough only 5-10% of the market has an obstructive median lobe, this enhancement demonstrates our commitment to R&D and expanding our BPH leadership.\nAs non-emergent procedures resumed in Q2, we launched a pilot national DTC campaign in early July, building on our successful regional efforts.\nThe campaign will run from July to December, aiming to reach the 50% of 12 million men treated for BPH who believe prescription medications are their only option.\nInitial patient response has been strong, with increased call volumes and web traffic to urolift.com.\nPhysician feedback has also been positive.\nWe submitted UroLift 2 for FDA 510(k) approval at the end of Q2.\nLastly, our interventional urology team has surpassed 200,000 patients treated with UroLift.\nWith U.S. DTC campaigns, about 2,700 trained urologists, and upcoming major market launches, we've only begun to address the estimated 100 million men globally with BPH.\nHere are the paraphrased sentences:\nLet's discuss some clinical updates in our Interventional business unit.\nWe've initiated enrollment for a prospective single-arm IDE study involving 150 patients across about 15 U.S. sites to assess the effectiveness of Teleflex's coronary guidewires and specialty catheters in chronic total occlusion percutaneous coronary intervention procedures.\nThe research will evaluate the performance of Teleflex's entire range of complex PCI products in chronic occlusive coronary disease, which presents the most challenging PCI environment.\nWe consider PCI a high-growth area within Interventional Cardiology, and we'll continue to invest in sectors that will enhance our weighted average market growth rates over time.\nWe persist in investing in clinical and commercial catalysts to maintain our upper single-digit revenue growth goals in a normalized environment.\nConsidering the previous discussion on the company's revenue performance, I'll start with the gross profit section.\nIn the quarter, adjusted gross profit decreased by approximately 19%, from $376.6 million in the previous year to $305.8 million.\nThe adjusted gross margin for the quarter was 53.9%, a decrease of 380 basis points compared to the same period last year.\nThe gross margin decline was mainly due to COVID-19-related impacts, including unfavorable product mix, reduced sales volumes, and increased manufacturing costs.\nThe impact on product mix was considerable for the quarter.\nThe negative revenue impact from COVID-19 tended to affect higher gross margin products more, including UroLift, Surgical, and Interventional Access.\nWe estimate that COVID-19 negatively impacted our adjusted gross profit by about $100 million in the quarter.\nDue to the reduced revenue and gross profit resulting from COVID-19, we continue to seek opportunities to mitigate the earnings impact while maintaining Teleflex's ability to quickly recover once non-emergency procedures resume.\nAs such, operating expense reductions focus on non-revenue-generating and discretionary categories, including savings from meetings, travel, and management variable and performance-based compensation.\nAs a result of these efforts, we estimate that operating expenses were reduced by approximately $35 million in the second quarter.\nWhile we expect the actions taken to continue providing opex savings through the second half of the year, the largest quarterly benefit will be realized in the second quarter.\nAdjusted operating profit decreased by approximately 25%, from $164.7 million in the previous year to $123.9 million.\nThe second quarter operating margin was 21.8%, down 340 basis points year-over-year, due to gross margin declines and loss of operating leverage, partially offset by reduced operating expenses.\nFor the quarter, net interest expense decreased by approximately 24% to $15.5 million compared to the previous year quarter.\nThe decrease in interest expense primarily reflects lower interest rates associated with our variable rate debt, partially offset by higher average debt balances in the second quarter of 2020 compared to the same period last year.\nDuring the quarter, we improved our liquidity by issuing $500 million of 8-year senior notes at 4.25%.\nThe proceeds from the note issuance were used to repay revolver borrowings.\nLet's move on to taxes.\nIn the second quarter of 2020, our adjusted tax rate increased to 15.8% from 13.4% in the same period last year.\nThe year-over-year increase in our adjusted tax rate is primarily due to less benefit from stock-based compensation compared to the previous year period.\nAt the bottom line, second quarter adjusted earnings per share decreased by 27.4% to $1.93.\nThis result includes an estimated adverse impact of $1.18 from COVID-19 and a foreign exchange headwind of approximately $0.04.\nNow I'd like to discuss our recently introduced workforce reduction plan.\nIn the second quarter of 2020, we committed to a workforce reduction plan designed to improve profitability by streamlining certain sales and marketing functions in our EMEA segment and certain manufacturing operations within our OEM segment.\nWe estimate that we will incur aggregate pre-tax restructuring charges between $10 million and $13 million, primarily consisting of termination benefits, which will result in future cash outlays.\nWe expect that most of these charges will be incurred before the end of 2020.\nOnce the plans are fully implemented, we project annual pre-tax savings between $11 million and $13 million, with savings expected to begin in 2020.\nI will also provide a summary of all our ongoing restructuring and cost savings programs.\nIncluding the latest workforce reduction plan, savings across all programs are expected to be between $59 million and $72 million.\nApproximately half of the savings are expected to be realized in 2020 and 2021, with the remaining half over the period 2022 through 2024.\nAs such, we have a clear view of non-revenue-dependent margin expansion in the foreseeable future.\nThis also reinforces our confidence that our prior LRP financial targets of 6% to 7% revenue growth, 60% to 61% gross margin, and 30% to 31% operating margin remain the appropriate goals for Teleflex.\nThe question is not if we achieve them, but when.\nLet's quickly review select balance sheet and cash flow highlights.\nFor the first half of 2020, cash flow from operations decreased by $23.3 million to $134 million, compared to $157.3 million in the same period last year.\nThe decrease is attributed to a $10 million pension contribution made in the first half of 2020 that was not made in the first half of the previous year, and a $54 million increase in first half 2020 contingent consideration payments compared to payments made in the first half of 2019.\nOverall, the balance sheet remains healthy.\nAt the end of the second quarter, our cash balance increased to $553 million from $406 million at the end of the first quarter.\nNet leverage at quarter end was approximately 2.6 times, providing comfortable headroom compared to our covenant, which requires that we stay below 4.5 times.\nLastly, we have no significant near-term debt maturities.\nBefore concluding, I'd like to inform you of a matter that will be disclosed in our 10-Q filed today.\nIn June, we began producing documents and information in response to a civil investigation demand received by our subsidiary, NeoTract, from the U.S. Department of Justice through the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Georgia.\nThe DOJ is seeking information about communications with and certain rebate programs offered to a single NeoTract customer as part of their investigation of that customer.\nSubsequently, in July, the DOJ informed us that they had opened an investigation under the Civil False Claims Act regarding NeoTract's operations broadly, in addition to the customer investigation.\nWe maintain policies and procedures to ensure compliance with the Anti-Kickback Statute, False Claims Act, and other applicable laws and regulations.\nWhile we intend to cooperate with the government's investigation and request for information, we will vigorously defend our programs, practices, and conduct, which we believe are lawful and in line with industry best practices and standards.\nWe cannot currently predict the duration, scope, or outcome of this matter with certainty.\nIn conclusion, we delivered solid second quarter results as our diversified portfolio helped mitigate the impact of COVID-19 during April, and procedures have shown month-over-month improvement in May, June, and into July.\nHowever, it remains challenging to predict the shape and duration of the recovery path.\nWhile the next several quarters will have elements of uncertainty, we remain confident in our long-term underlying fundamentals and see great opportunities to serve our key constituents in the future.\nAs an organization, we will continue to focus on serving the majority of hospitals that remain open for procedures while closely monitoring select regions that are temporarily shut down.\nWe continue to adapt our business and opportunistically shift towards greater emphasis on digital tools, both internally and with our customers.\nWe will manage the business prudently while staying focused on capitalizing on the long-term potential of our global product portfolio.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:During this conference call, management will discuss current business performance between quarters\nThe company is sharing these insights with investors to provide additional context, which may not be available in future quarters\nWe're glad to be speaking with you today\nTeleflex achieved significant revenue growth in constant currency and a 27% increase in adjusted earnings per share year-over-year in Q3, despite greater challenges from rising COVID-19 cases due to the Delta variant\nAll of our global product categories saw growth in constant currency compared to last year, except for the \"other\" category due to selling respiratory assets to Medline\nWhile macroeconomic conditions changed from Q2 expectations, Teleflex's strong Q3 2021 performance highlights the benefits of our diverse business and broad portfolio of essential medical products where we have market leadership\nOur six main product categories and global presence helped offset declines in elective surgery-related revenues that were impacted by pauses in Q3\nInvestors may be aware that elective surgeries were restricted in up to 28 states during Q3\nHowever, as we've seen throughout the pandemic, our diverse portfolio provides protection during COVID surges, with over 60% of our business either benefiting from or being relatively unaffected by pandemic disruptions\nAlthough we don't usually provide updates within quarters, I'll share some Q3 details given the larger-than-expected increase in Delta variant cases\nCompared to our Q2 earnings guidance, we saw a bigger pause in elective procedures than anticipated across parts of the US, Europe and Asia\nHowever, as COVID-19 cases declined, we saw daily sales improve for products tied to elective surgeries as we progressed through September\nIn Q3, our Americas, EMEA, Asia and OEM segments showed resilience with all regions achieving constant currency revenue growth over 2020 despite Delta variant headwinds\nThis underscores the advantage of our diverse product portfolio\nQ3 gross and operating margins exceeded levels from comparable periods in 2020 and 2019\nOur continued margin expansion in 2021 has allowed us to increase targeted investments in growth drivers, an important part of our long-term strategy to enhance sustainable growth\nWe remain aware of uncertainty around COVID-19 as colder weather approaches in the Northern Hemisphere, new variants emerge, and healthcare worker shortages persist\nAs such, we think it's prudent to assume COVID-19 will remain a headwind and that a broad return to normal elective surgery volumes is unlikely in Q4\nWe expect these factors to be temporary, with a more normal environment likely in 2022\nBased on year-to-date results and Q4 outlook, we're lowering our constant currency revenue growth forecast to 8-9% from 8.5-9.75% previously\nThis revision is mainly due to lower growth expectations for products used in elective procedures\nHowever, given strong operating margin performance and balance sheet improvements, we're raising earnings per share guidance to $13.15-$13.35 from $12.90-$13.10 previously, implying 23-25% year-over-year growth\nNow for a more detailed review of our Q3 results\nQ3 revenue was $700.3 million, up 10.3% year-over-year in constant currency\nThis increase reflects our diverse portfolio's benefit and contributions from all segments, offset by COVID-19 impacts and the respiratory asset sale to Medline\nCompared to Q3 2019, revenue increased 5.8% with accelerating growth in Vascular, OEM and Anesthesia, offsetting slowdowns in areas more exposed to the COVID-19 surge like Interventional Urology, Interventional and Surgical\nQ3 growth and operating margin exceeded expectations, showing our diverse portfolio's strength, partially offset by greater-than-anticipated COVID-19 headwinds\nOur year-to-date margin performance is encouraging for our long-term profitability goals\nQ3 adjusted earnings per share of $3.51 increased 26.7% year-over-year, exceeding internal expectations\nDespite higher COVID-19 headwinds, Q3 earnings performance reflects growth in our diverse portfolio, modest price increases, expanded gross margins and better-than-expected expense management\nWe continue executing our strategy for sustainable growth by investing in organic opportunities, innovation, margin expansion and using capital to reduce debt and pursue M&A\nI'm proud of how our team continues to perform in a challenging environment\nOur Q3 financial results demonstrate our diverse global portfolio's resilience, targeted growth investments in areas like UroLift and MANTA, and progress toward long-term margin goals\nNow for a deeper look at revenue results\nI'll start by reviewing our reportable segment revenues\nAmericas revenues were $417.3 million in Q3, up 10.9% year-over-year\nGrowth came from Surgical, Vascular and Interventional, partially offset by elective procedure pauses\nEMEA revenues of $143.9 million increased 3.6% year-over-year, led by Interventional and Vascular products\nEMEA benefited from improved procedure volumes compared to last year as countries reopened, despite some COVID-19 disruptions\nAsia revenues were $75 million, up 6.3% year-over-year\nJapan performed strongly, growing over 30%, but was partially offset by COVID-19 impacts in Southeast Asia\nNow let's discuss Q3 revenues by global product category\nAs with segment reporting, global product category growth will be discussed in constant currency and ranked by business unit size\nThere were no significant differences in year-over-year selling days in Q3\nStarting with Vascular Access, Q3 revenue increased 8.5% to $175.5 million\nOur leadership in central venous catheters and midlines, along with our innovative coated PICC portfolio, continues to drive reliable growth\nVascular Access products remain important for COVID-19 patient treatment, contributing to Q3 strength due to increased infections\nOur PICC portfolio continues to perform well, growing 10% year-over-year\nWe're investing in our differentiated PICC portfolio and gaining market share\nIntraosseous also performed well in Q3, growing 12% year-over-year\nQ3 revenue for Interventional was $104.3 million, up 10.4% year-over-year\nWe executed well in Q3, though increased COVID-19 cases slowed complex PCI and TAVR procedures\nWe continue investing in our interventional portfolio, including complex catheters and MANTA, our large-bore closure device\nMANTA momentum remains strong globally, with over 80% growth year-over-year in Q3\nGiven MANTA's year-to-date performance, we're confident in achieving 8% share in 2021 of the $200-300 million global market opportunity\nLet's now discuss Anesthesia.\nIn Q3, revenue reached $97.1 million, showing a 26.6% increase compared to the previous year.\nZ-Medica products were responsible for approximately 85% of the growth, aligning with our projected revenue of $60-70 million for 2021, while tracheostomy product sales decreased.\nThe Surgical division's revenue totaled $92.8 million, reflecting a 10.9% year-over-year increase.\nOur major product categories experienced significant growth in ligation clips and instruments sales due to a more favorable elective surgical procedure environment than the previous year, partially counterbalanced by the Delta variant's impact in certain areas.\nUrology's Q3 revenue amounted to $83.1 million, a 1.5% year-over-year increase, which fell short of our expectations from the Q2 conference call.\nThe quarter was affected by elective surgery cancellations due to state restrictions and ICU capacity limitations as Delta variant cases surged in specific U.S. regions, along with ongoing pandemic-related business disruptions.\nWe are carefully observing trends in our UroLift business.\nNotably, our analysis of commercial and Medicare billing claims over the past six months shows that UroLift has maintained its market share against competing minimally invasive BPH treatments and remains the leading procedure.\nCOVID-19 continues to have the most significant impact on UroLift utilization, with physician office staffing shortages also affecting the business.\nWe view both of these impacts as temporary and anticipate a more normalized environment in 2022.\nThe preference for UroLift is sustained by strong clinical outcomes, with studies demonstrating rapid symptom relief and recovery, no new sustained sexual dysfunction, and long-lasting results.\nOur analysis reveals that very few of our experienced users offer alternative technologies for BPH treatment due to their confidence in UroLift.\nThe UroLift system remains unique among device-based BPH treatments, and we aim to maintain our leading position in day surgery treatments for this condition.\nWe continue to focus on patients suffering from BPH who have either failed or are dissatisfied with drug therapy, estimated to be 1.5 million men in the United States.\nLooking ahead to Q4 2021, we expect a relatively stable macro environment compared to our September trends, given persistent COVID-19 challenges for elective surgical procedures.\nConsidering the lower-than-expected UroLift revenues in Q3 and our revised Q4 projections, we are reducing our 2021 Interventional Urology revenue growth guidance to 15-17% year-over-year.\nWe anticipate a more normal environment for elective surgical procedures to emerge in 2022.\nWe remain encouraged by physician engagement, as measured by our active users, new physician training, and the ability to perform UroLift procedures in all relevant care settings.\nOur OEM business, representing about 9% of total sales, grew 29.4% year-over-year to $64.1 million in Q3.\nWe continue to see strength in our OEM business as customer ordering normalizes, and we remain well-positioned in our markets with customers valuing our design and manufacturing capabilities.\nLastly, our other category, comprising respiratory products not included in the Medline divestiture, manufacturing service agreement revenues, and Urology Care products, decreased by 4.3% to $83.4 million year-over-year.\nThe decline primarily reflects the loss of revenue due to the respiratory products divestiture, partially offset by manufacturing service agreement revenues and growth in Urology Care.\nWe expect manufacturing service agreement revenues to phase out by the end of 2023.\nThis concludes my remarks on the Q3 revenue performance.\nShifting to commercial updates, starting with UroLift.\nIn Q3, we trained 124 urologists.\nInterest in UroLift remains strong, and with over 355 doctors trained year-to-date, we are on track to meet our training target of 450-500 urologists in 2021.\nRegarding our consumer marketing efforts.\nWe continue to view direct-to-consumer as a multi-year catalyst for UroLift in the United States.\nWe have maintained funding for our DTC campaign to prepare for the recovery in elective procedures and will continue investing in Q4.\nWe recently received a bronze award for best new branded television campaign from DTC perspective, a significant achievement given 13 finalists.\nSearch interest for UroLift remains high and well above other minimally invasive BPH treatments, with most urologist surveys indicating patients inquiring about the UroLift System.\nMoving to UroLift 2.\nWe are proceeding with a full rollout in the United States.\nWe officially launched the product and the UroLift ATC to the broader urology community at the AUA meeting in September.\nWe are well-positioned to transition the majority of physician customers to UroLift 2 by the end of 2022, driven by improvements in tissue compression, reduced storage space, and increased manufacturing capacity.\nUroLift 2 remains an important margin driver, as we are on track to achieve 400 basis points of UroLift gross margin expansion once the revenue base is fully converted.\nRegarding Japan, we continue to make progress towards an upcoming commercial launch for UroLift.\nRecently, the three major Japanese urology societies agreed on guidelines for UroLift usage, which is a positive development.\nConcerning reimbursement approval, we remain highly engaged with the MHLW and have been officially notified that UroLift will be reviewed at an expert panel in November.\nAlthough we cannot control the regulatory pathway's timing, the panel confirmation is a crucial milestone towards reimbursement in Japan, marking one of the final steps in the process.\nOur baseline assumptions for the commercial ramp beginning in 2022 remain unchanged.\nJapan remains an important long-term opportunity for UroLift with a $2 billion TAM, and we are excited about our upcoming launch.\nWe continue to expect our sales in the region to ramp up similarly to the U.S. in a market that is 1/3 the size.\nBeyond Japan, our international regulatory and commercialization efforts for UroLift remain active.\nOn a positive note, we are excited about our initial commercial activity in Brazil.\nAlthough we had been expecting to enter Brazil in late 2022, we have shortened our timeline with a limited market release late in Q3 2021.\nWe have made good progress with select key opinion leader training, and initial UroLift cases have already been performed in hospital and office settings.\nAlthough it is early, and the market will take time to develop, Brazil remains an important geography in our expansion of UroLift outside the United States, and we are encouraged by the early experience.\nRegarding U.S. reimbursement, and as a reminder, CMS published its proposed physician fee schedule for calendar 2022 on July 13, 2021.\nThe proposed rule would negatively impact reimbursement for approximately 600 procedures performed in doctors' offices across a wide range of surgical specialties, with a disproportionate effect on device-heavy procedures like UroLift.\nTeleflex provided a detailed response to CMS during the public comment period regarding our position on the proposed rule.\nWe believe that the changes to the physician fee schedule would restrict healthcare access for Medicare patients and shift procedures to more expensive sites of service.\nTeleflex, along with numerous other stakeholders, have urged CMS to delay the implementation of the proposed physician fee schedule until additional analysis can be performed, given the unintended consequences of the current proposed route.\nWe expect the final rule to be published in November, consistent with historical timing.\nWe are satisfied with the success of our recently introduced Arrow ErgoPack kit, which generated over $5 million in revenue during Q3.\nThe new kit configuration for our CVC catheters includes a kink-resistant nitinol guidewire, which is an improvement that medical professionals appreciate.\nOur dominant market position in CVCs is reinforced by this launch, which serves as a trade-up strategy to increase gross profit and maintain our leadership.\nRegarding our acquisition of Z-Medica, which was finalized in December 2020, the integration is progressing slightly faster than our internal expectations, and we are content with the progress.\nWe have finished enrolling patients in a 231-person IDE study to evaluate the effectiveness of QuikClot Control+ hemostatic devices for mild-to-moderate bleeding in cardiac procedures compared to standard methods, with the aim of expanding the hemostat portfolio's label.\nWe plan to submit a 510(k) application for expanded use of QuikClot Control+ after the study is completed.\nFollowing the previous discussion of the company's revenue performance, I will start with the gross profit section.\nIn Q3, adjusted gross margin reached 59.5%, an increase of 230 basis points compared to the same period last year.\nThe improvement in gross margin year-over-year was attributed to product and regional mix, cost-saving initiatives, favorable pricing, M&A, and foreign exchange effects, partially offset by increases in raw material and distribution costs.\nQ3 adjusted operating margin was 28.5%, a 340 basis point increase year-over-year, driven by improved gross margin and careful expense management, partially offset by planned business investments.\nNet interest expense for the quarter was $11.8 million, down from $16.4 million in the same period last year.\nThe decrease in net interest expense is due to savings from redeeming the 2026 notes and the impact of debt reduction using proceeds from the respiratory divestiture and operating cash flows.\nOur Q3 2021 adjusted tax rate was 11.3%, compared to 7% in the same period last year.\nThe increase in our adjusted tax rate is mainly due to a reduced benefit from stock-based compensation compared to the previous year.\nQ3 adjusted earnings per share grew by 26.7% to $3.51.\nThis result includes an estimated positive impact of approximately $0.13 per share from foreign exchange compared to the previous year.\nYear-to-date cash flow from operations totaled $450.5 million, a $209 million increase from $241.5 million in the same period last year.\nThe increase was primarily due to improved operating results, lower contingent consideration payments, reduced payroll and benefit-related payments, and proceeds from the manufacturing supply agreement with Medline.\nOur financial position remains strong.\nAt the end of Q3 2021, our cash balance was $481.2 million, up from $375.9 million at the end of Q4 2020.\nWe made a $259 million payment in July against our revolving credit facility, using funds mainly generated from the initial close of the respiratory business divestiture.\nAt the end of Q3, we had $342 million drawn on our revolver, and net leverage was approximately 2 times.\nWe are updating our 2021 constant currency revenue growth guidance to 8% to 9% year-over-year, down from 8.5% to 9.75% previously.\nThis outlook reflects the benefits of our diversified portfolio, offset by lower UroLift revenues due to a slower recovery in elective surgical procedures than previously assumed.\nWe continue to expect a 2% positive impact on reported revenue from foreign exchange rates in 2021, unchanged from our previous assumption.\nAs a result, we are revising our as-reported revenue growth guidance to 10% to 11% year-over-year, down from 10.5% to 11.75% previously.\nThe updated guidance would equate to a revenue range of $2.791 billion to $2.186 billion.\nWe are lowering the top end of our 2021 adjusted gross margin guidance by 25 basis points to a range of 59.25% to 59.5%.\nYear-over-year gross margin expansion is expected to be driven by a favorable mix of high-margin products, manufacturing productivity improvements, and benefits from previously announced Footprint restructuring programs, partially offset by inflation.\nThe revised outlook is associated with lower UroLift revenues and higher-than-expected inflation.\nOur expectation that Z-Medica will add approximately 50 basis points to gross margin for 2021 remains unchanged.\nWe continue to experience increased cost pressures in raw materials, freight, and to a lesser extent, labor.\nMost of our sea freight lane contracts expired at the end of September, with the remainder expiring at the end of the year.\nDue to expiring shipping contracts and increasing inflation, we now estimate that inflationary costs will be roughly $3 million higher in Q4 than in Q3.\nThis impact is reflected in our revised gross margin guidance.\nWe are increasing our 2021 adjusted operating margin guidance range to 27.5% to 28%, up 75 basis points at the low end and 50 basis points at the high end compared to previous guidance.\nThe increase in adjusted operating margin reflects year-to-date performance, partially offset by the lower gross margin outlook.\nWe now expect interest expense to be roughly $57 million, down from our previous guidance of $60 million to $62 million.\nThe decrease in net interest expense for 2021 largely reflects a reduction in debt, funded by proceeds from the respiratory divestiture and strong cash flow generation.\nWe now expect our adjusted tax rate for 2021 to be roughly 12% to 13%, down from the prior range of 13% to 13.5%.\nWe are raising our adjusted earnings per share

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:I'm William Prate, leading Global Financial Planning and Analysis and Investor Relations as Senior Director.\nOur COO, Dave Huml, is unable to participate in the call due to a family situation.\nChris will update you on our operations and our progress towards our company strategy, followed by Andy presenting the financial details.\nWe'll then open the floor for questions after their presentations.\nThese potential risks and uncertainties are outlined in today's press release and in our SEC filings.\nWe urge you to examine these documents, particularly our safe harbor statement, which describes potential risks and uncertainties that could impact our results.\nDuring this call, we'll also discuss non-GAAP measures that either include or exclude certain items.\nWe sincerely hope you and your family are staying healthy during this pandemic.\nAs you may have noticed, we recently commemorated Tennant's 150th year in business this September.\nAlthough our current business environment is vastly different from what our founder George Tennant faced in 1870, the company has consistently maintained a tradition of innovation and adaptability, as evidenced by our ability to evolve and remain relevant to our customers.\nWhen the pandemic began, we acted swiftly and established three key principles: ensuring the safety of our employees and customers, managing our expenses and cash flow, and maintaining readiness to scale up operations when markets recover.\nSimultaneously, we fulfilled our commitment to provide our customers with innovative solutions to maintain clean and safe facilities.\nWe maintained this approach in the third quarter and observed promising signs of recovery across all our regions.\nOur teams worldwide have worked diligently to overcome the unprecedented sales and operational challenges caused by the pandemic, collaborating closely with our customers, supply chain partners, and carriers to prevent operational disruptions.\nMoreover, the implementation of our Enterprise Strategy resulted in improvements in our operating performance, with third quarter EBITDA growth, despite a year-over-year decrease in organic sales due to COVID-19.\nAlthough the pandemic continues to create significant macro-level uncertainty, particularly as some markets experience increases in COVID-19 cases, we are highly confident in our near-term business outlook.\nAs Andy will explain shortly, we are reintroducing our full-year guidance for 2020, which reflects not only our revenue and profitability expectations but also our commitment to investing in our business to support our long-term enterprise strategy.\nThis strategy encompasses winning in areas where we have a competitive advantage, simplifying processes and building scalable systems, and innovating for profitable growth.\nWhile the global economic impact of the pandemic was unforeseen a year ago, it hasn't diminished our ability to execute our enterprise strategy, as the key elements are all within our control.\nFor instance, while innovating for profitable growth may seem like an ambitious goal, for Tennant it represents our approach to leveraging customer insights and our exceptional engineering capabilities to solve real-world problems.\nA recent example of this commitment is our October 1st launch of the new T380AMR, which complements our existing robotic lineup by offering a smaller-sized machine that improves maneuverability and navigation for customers with smaller spaces.\nThis new product and our ongoing partnership with Brain Corporation enabled us to finalize agreements in the third quarter to supply two national retailers and a separate regional retailer with our complete range of autonomous floor scrubbers.\nFurthermore, we are beginning to achieve success in additional sectors such as logistics, education, and aviation.\nAfter our initial launch with Walmart earlier this year, these successes show how we continue to innovate and provide value to a wider range of customers.\nAs part of our company-wide strategy, we recently brought on Dan Glusick as our new Senior Vice President of Operations, who will report directly to our Chief Operating Officer, Dave Huml.\nWith over 25 years of experience in global operations leadership, Dan brings extensive enterprise management skills and in-depth expertise across manufacturing operations, supply chain management, and company-wide transformation.\nDan's appointment is crucial and he will play a key role in implementing our Enterprise Strategy as we enhance our supply chain and streamline our operations to support our product standardization and localization initiatives.\nTo sum up, this is a critical area of focus as we prepare Tennant for success in the post-pandemic era.\nFinally, given the improving demand trends we've observed since May and our confidence in our business's improved trajectory, we recognize the need to make strategic investments to support ongoing strategy execution, fill key leadership positions, and recognize and retain our top talent.\nThis aligns with the guiding principles we established at the beginning of the pandemic.\nWe started making these investments in the third quarter and will continue to do so in the fourth quarter.\nThese investments are crucial for supporting our customers, emerging strong as markets recover, and continuing to create value for shareholders.\nPlease be aware that any references to earnings per share in my comments today, both GAAP and non-GAAP, are on a fully diluted basis.\nAs Chris mentioned, while Tennant's third quarter results continued to show the impact of the pandemic, we observed some positive trends across all our regions.\nFor the third quarter of 2020, Tennant reported total net sales of $261.9 million, a decrease of 6.7% compared to the same period last year.\nOrganic sales, which don't include the effects of currency fluctuations, dropped by 7.1%.\nThis represents a significant improvement in our sales performance compared to the 27% decline we saw in the second quarter.\nIn the third quarter, we reported net earnings of $11.7 million or $0.63 per share, down from $14.6 million or $0.79 per share in the same period last year.\nAdjusted EPS, which excludes certain non-operational items and amortization, was $0.90 compared to $0.85 in the previous year.\nLet's now examine our third quarter sales results by geographic region, which we divide into three areas: The Americas, including all of North America and Latin America; EMEA, covering Europe, the Middle East and Africa; and Asia Pacific, which includes China, Japan, Australia and other Asian markets.\nSales in the Americas decreased by 9.9% year-over-year and fell 8.8% organically.\nDecreases in direct Industrial business sales and distributor sales were partially offset by the ongoing success of Tennant's AMR platform and strong growth in Brazil.\nSales in EMEA declined by 0.3%, or 4.5% organically, in the quarter due to market weakness across the region.\nThe declines were primarily in the United Kingdom and the Iberian Peninsula, which counteracted growth in France and Italy.\nSales in the APAC region decreased by 0.8%, or 2.3% organically.\nDeclines in Southeast Asia and Korea were partially balanced by growth in direct sales in Australia.\nThe Company's service, parts, and consumables business continued to be a strong point overall.\nDespite a 12% decrease in equipment sales compared to the previous year's quarter, aftermarket revenue increased by 6% over the same period, reflecting our efforts to assist customers with their evolving cleaning requirements during the pandemic.\nThe adjusted gross margins for the third quarters of 2020 and 2019 were 40.2% and 40.8% respectively.\nThe year-on-year decrease is attributed to various strategic investments and reduced leverage due to lower volume, which were partially mitigated by cost-cutting measures driven by strategic initiatives.\nRegarding expenses, our adjusted S&A costs were 29.8% of net sales in the third quarter, compared to 31.2% in the same period last year, primarily due to cost-saving efforts and adjustments to management incentives.\nWe made several strategic investments during the quarter.\nDue to the economic uncertainties caused by the pandemic, careful management of S&A expenses remains a crucial part of our strategy.\nOur EBITDA for the third quarter of 2020 was $32.6 million, or 12.4% of sales, compared to $31.4 million, or 11.2% of sales, in the third quarter of 2019.\nThe increase in percentage of sales was due to adjustments in management incentives and reductions in discretionary spending implemented during the quarter.\nThe Company's adjusted effective tax rate for the third quarter was 11.3%, compared to 16.1% in the same period last year.\nThe lower tax rate was primarily due to an increase in discrete tax items and a favorable earnings mix.\nLet's now discuss cash flow, capital allocation, and balance sheet items.\nTennant generated $48.9 million in cash flow from operations in the third quarter of 2020, mainly driven by business performance and improvements in working capital.\nWe repaid an additional $17 million of debt in the third quarter.\nAs of September 30th, we had $124.7 million in cash and cash equivalents, and approximately $172 million in undrawn funds on our revolver.\nNow, let's address guidance.\nIn April, we withdrew our full-year guidance provided in February due to the pandemic's uncertainty.\nAlthough uncertainty remains in the market, we now have more confidence in our short-term projections and are reintroducing full-year guidance for 2020.\nOur full-year 2020 guidance, as stated in today's earnings announcement, is as follows: Net sales of $995 million to $1,005 million with organic sales declining 12.5% to 11.5%; GAAP earnings of $2.00 to $2.20 per share; adjusted earnings per share of $2.80 to $3.00, excluding certain non-operational items and amortization expense; adjusted EBITDA between $116 million and $121 million; capital expenditures of about $35 million; and an effective tax rate of approximately 17%.\nIt's important to note that our guidance includes approximately $5 million to $8 million in government benefits, primarily from wage subsidies mentioned in our second quarter results.\nAs Chris mentioned, this guidance includes continued investment in our business to support our enterprise strategy.\nWhile we believe underlying business performance is improving and expect revenue to increase sequentially quarter-over-quarter, it's important to note that organic sales will face a challenging year-over-year comparison, as Q4 2019 was Tennant's second-highest revenue quarter ever.\nAs a result, we anticipate that our implied fourth quarter organic decline will be greater than the third quarter, and due to continued strategic investments, our expected EBITDA dollar and percent of revenue will be lower than previous quarters.\nWe will now open the call for questions.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Furthermore, David Bray, Noelle O'Mara, Shane Miller, and Chris Langholz, who are group presidents of various divisions, will participate in the live Q&A portion of the event.\nWe disclosed our financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 earlier today.\nTyson Foods has again produced impressive financial outcomes.\nDuring our Investor Day, I outlined our strategy for significant growth in both revenue and profit over the next three years.\nThis strategy aimed for high single-digit growth in earnings per share compared to 2019, as well as volume growth surpassing market rates.\nOur performance this quarter puts us on track to achieve these goals.\nWe experienced growth of over 10% in both sales and earnings, driven by sustained strong demand, efficiency gains, and enhanced execution across all segments.\nOur success can be attributed to our diverse protein offerings, multi-channel capabilities, well-known brands, and value-added products.\nStrong performance in beef, a quicker-than-anticipated recovery in prepared foods, and improvements in chicken and pork all contributed to robust earnings.\nOur core retail product lines, which include our well-known brands like Tyson, Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm, and Ball Park, maintained their market share despite price increases to offset inflationary pressures.\nIn foodservice, our Focus 6 product lines gained market share year-over-year in broad-line distribution.\nThis growth was largely due to value-added chicken products outperforming industry recovery, and improved supply of breakfast sausage.\nNotably, despite the ongoing impact of COVID-19, our overall volumes slightly increased compared to the same quarter last year.\nChicken was a standout, with volumes improving by 3.6%.\nWhile this is a good start, we haven't yet reached our desired volume levels.\nWe're implementing specific strategies in each segment to boost our volume performance.\nThese strategies include investing in our workforce, expanding capacity, and developing new brands and products.\nAs mentioned at Investor Day, we're also constructing 12 new facilities.\nEach of these projects is progressing and will help Tyson address capacity limitations and meet the growing global demand for protein.\nUltimately, we're committed to improving our overall company volumes throughout the year.\nWe're also ensuring that our pricing reflects the inflationary cost pressures on our business.\nIn the first quarter, our cost of goods sold increased by 18% compared to the same period last year.\nWe're experiencing higher costs across our supply chain, including increased input costs such as feed and ingredients.\nWe're also managing higher labor and transportation costs due to strong demand and limited availability.\nTo address these higher costs, we work closely with our customers to ensure fair pricing for our products.\nAs a result, our average sales price for the quarter rose by 19.6% compared to the same period last year.\nThis helped us recover some of the costs that were previously unrecovered due to the lag between inflation and price adjustments.\nOur strong balance sheet and overall liquidity position provide us with flexibility to pursue strategic growth priorities and invest across our portfolio.\nWe take a disciplined approach to capital deployment, supporting capacity expansion while aiming for improved returns on invested capital.\nOur first-quarter results clearly show that we're making progress on our growth objectives, remaining focused on outpacing the overall market, improving operating margins, and delivering strong returns for our shareholders.\nAs we grow our business, we remain mindful of our corporate responsibilities regarding environmental, social, and governance goals.\nFor instance, we're committed to investing in and supporting rural communities in America and around the world.\nLast year, Tyson Foods donated over 16 million pounds of protein, equivalent to 64 million meals, to combat hunger.\nWe're extremely proud of this work and the people who make it possible.\nTyson is an excellent company with a great team doing important work, and we're pleased that Fortune Magazine recognized this by ranking Tyson Foods No. 1 in our sector for the sixth consecutive year in their list of the world's most admired companies.\nLet's review some key financial highlights from the first quarter.\nOur results showed double-digit growth in both top and bottom lines.\nWe delivered strong operating income performance, up 40% for the quarter.\nThis performance was broad-based across segments, with continued strong consumer demand and effective pricing to mitigate inflation driving higher earnings.\nOur volume increased slightly overall.\nWhile we're working to achieve optimal throughput across segments, labor challenges are still impacting our volumes and our ability to achieve the best product mix across our network.\nCompared to pre-pandemic levels, our volume performance is outpacing our competitors.\nIn retail, despite significant market pressures, our core business lines maintained market share in the first quarter, led by strong performance in lunch meat, hot dogs, snacks, and bacon.\nWe also saw strong e-commerce results, with Tyson Foods outpacing total food and beverage growth in our core lines and gaining market share in the quarter.\nHowever, customer demand continues to exceed our production capacity.\nWe have targeted actions in each segment to improve volumes, which is crucial to meeting our commitments.\nTo achieve our volume goals, we must be able to fully staff our plants across the company.\nWe continue to take significant steps to become the most desirable workplace.\nFor example, we provided our hourly team members with over $50 million in bonuses during the first quarter.\nWe're piloting subsidized and on-site childcare, and we're adjusting schedules to accommodate workforce needs.\nThese efforts are showing results as we see some improvement in labor conditions.\nWhile we experienced some labor challenges during the Omicron surge, we're generally seeing lower turnover and absenteeism.\nOur chicken volumes grew by 3.6% in the quarter, driven by strong fundamental demand and improved live production.\nImportantly, we grew faster than the market and gained market share.\nIn prepared foods, volumes decreased by 2.6% in the first quarter.\nAbout half of this decline was due to the divestiture of our pet treats business.\nWe expect to gradually improve these results over the remainder of fiscal year 2022 as we take actions to expand and improve capacity utilization.\nIn beef, volumes decreased by 6.2%, primarily due to the labor shortages mentioned earlier.\nAdditionally, port congestion has affected export volumes in this segment.\nWe expect these volume headwinds to normalize over the course of fiscal 2022.\nIn pork, we have sequentially improved our capacity utilization.\nWe are still working to refine our product mix.\nIn our international and other segments, despite starting from a small base, our investments in capacity, innovation, and branding are supporting our goal of market share expansion.\nWe anticipate growing our overall company volumes by 2-3% in fiscal year 2022, surpassing the growth rate of protein consumption.\nImproving our chicken segment remains a top focus, and we're executing our plan to reach an operating income margin of 5-7% on a run-rate basis by mid-fiscal 2022.\nI'm confident we will achieve this target.\nIn the first quarter, we've begun to see improvements in profitability as a result of our actions.\nFor instance, we're heavily investing in automation and technology to address some of the most challenging positions to fill.\nThis isn't a collection of isolated projects, but a well-planned program using common designs and equipment across our facilities to optimize costs, maintenance, and asset utilization.\nThe second key objective is to enhance operational performance, with a critical focus on maximizing our fixed cost leverage by ensuring we have enough resources to run our plants at full capacity.\nSince September, we've observed an improvement in our hatch rate that has exceeded our expectations.\nWe continue to anticipate a full recovery this year.\nWe were satisfied with our volume growth in the quarter and expect further improvements as we increase our harvest capacity utilization from an average of 37 million head per week in fiscal year 2021 to 40 million head per week by the end of the year.\nWe've previously mentioned that strong spot prices for commodity chicken products put our buy versus grow program at a comparative disadvantage.\nAs a result, we've reduced our reliance on external meat sources.\nWe are committed to staffing our plants, serving our customers, growing our volumes, and becoming the industry leader.\nOur current plan remains the right approach, and our dedication to succeeding with our team members, customers, consumers, and operational excellence is yielding results.\nLast year, we announced a new productivity program aimed at creating a more efficient, agile organization supported by a culture of continuous improvement and faster decision-making.\nThe program targets $1 billion in recurring productivity savings by the end of fiscal year 2024 compared to the fiscal 2021 cost baseline, focusing on three key areas: operational and functional excellence, digital solutions, and automation.\nWe're making good progress in this area.\nI recently mentioned our investments in automation, but we've also addressed other issues.\nIn our Prepared Foods segment, we're utilizing supply chain digitization and advanced analytics.\nOur digital manufacturing platform enables us to analyze real-time data to optimize process conditions, resulting in better yields, lower costs, consistent quality, and increased output.\nIn transportation and logistics, we've established ongoing optimization of our private, dedicated, and third-party fleet mix and allocation, mitigating inflationary pressures and improving on-time deliveries to our customers.\nWe've also continued expanding our direct shipment program, reducing miles driven and product handling in our supply chain.\nThese projects have put us on track to achieve $300 million to $400 million in savings for fiscal year 2022.\nAt our Investor Day, we shared our plans to accelerate growth and drive disciplined return on invested capital.\nThe five key imperatives shown here outline how we'll meet our commitments and create value.\nOur primary focus is on our team members, ensuring their health, safety, and well-being, as well as fostering an inclusive and equitable work environment.\nWe're proud of the COVID-19 vaccine policy we implemented in the U.S. last year and the broader investments we've made to protect our team members, their families, and our communities.\nOur policy has resulted in better protection for our team members, with any cases we do see being mild or asymptomatic, leading to very few hospitalizations.\nWe're strongly encouraging booster shots and hosting clinics to make it easier for our team members and their families to get boosted.\nSecondly, we're working to improve our portfolio and capacity to better meet demand, including increasing the proportion of branded and value-added sales.\nAs a result, we expect our volume growth to outpace the market.\nThird, we're aggressively working to restore competitiveness in our chicken segment, starting with returning our operating margin to the 5-7% range by mid-fiscal 2022.\nFourth, we're focusing on operational and functional excellence and investing in digital and automation initiatives as part of our new productivity program.\nWe're working hard to eliminate waste, reduce bureaucracy, and improve decision-making speed across the organization.\nFifth, to address projected demand growth over the next decade, we're using our financial strength to invest in our business.\nWe plan to invest $2 billion in capital expenditures in fiscal year 2022, with a significant portion focused on new capacity and automation objectives.\nWe're also continuing to return cash to shareholders, having returned over $500 million in dividends and share repurchases during the quarter.\nIn conclusion, we're committed to succeeding with our team members, customers, and consumers, as well as achieving operational excellence.\nI'm increasingly optimistic about Tyson Foods' future with each passing day.\nLet me begin by summarizing our overall company financial results.\nWe're pleased to report a strong start to the year, with first-quarter sales up approximately 24%, primarily due to our pricing initiatives to offset inflationary pressures.\nVolumes also increased slightly, though they were impacted by ongoing labor challenges.\nExamining our sales results by channel, retail drove almost $350 million in top-line improvements compared to last year.\nImprovements in foodservice channel sales led to a $1 billion increase, and our export sales were nearly $333 million stronger than the same period last year as we leveraged our global scale to grow our business.\nFirst-quarter operating income of $1.4 billion was 40% higher than the same quarter last year, driven by increased earnings in beef, pork, and chicken segments.\nThe strong operating income led to a 48% increase in first-quarter earnings per share, reaching $2.87.\nHigher operating income resulted in higher adjusted earnings per share compared to the same period last year.\nFirst-quarter earnings per share also benefited from lower net interest expense and taxes.\nSlide 10 illustrates the year-to-date operating income, which was $407 million higher than fiscal 2021.\nVolumes increased slightly during the year, primarily due to improvements in chicken, pork, and international/other segments, offset by declines in beef and prepared foods.\nDeclines in beef and prepared foods were largely attributed to ongoing labor challenges in those segments.\nOur pricing actions resulted in approximately $2.1 billion in sales and price/mix benefits during the quarter, offsetting the $1.6 billion increase in cost of goods sold.\nWe experienced continued inflation across the business, with some instances seeing increases of 20% to 30%.\nNotable examples included labor, grain costs, live cattle and hog costs, and freight costs.\nLastly, SG&A was $88 million less favorable compared to the same period last year, largely due to cycling a $55 million benefit recorded last year for the recovery of cattle.\nLet's examine the beef division.\nQuarterly segment revenue exceeded $5 billion, a 25% increase from the previous year's same period.\nStrong demand for beef products fueled sales growth, supporting higher average prices.\nHigher capital costs in the first quarter compared to last year partially offset increased sales prices.\nSufficient livestock was available during the quarter due to strong early supplies.\nWe have good insight into cattle availability through fiscal 2022 and expect it to meet customer needs.\nThe segment's operating income reached $956 million, an 81% increase from the same period last year.\nThis improvement resulted from strong global demand for beef products and higher cutout prices, partially counterbalanced by increased operating costs.\nOur 19.1% operating margin was significantly higher than last year's same quarter but decreased sequentially compared to the previous two quarters as cost increases narrowed the spread.\nNow we'll discuss the pork segment.\nQuarterly segment sales surpassed $1.6 billion, a 13% increase from the previous year's same period.\nKey sales drivers included higher average prices due to strong demand and increased hog costs, partially offset by a challenging labor environment.\nAverage sales price rose 12.8% with slightly higher volumes compared to last year's same period.\nThe segment's quarterly operating income was $164 million, a 41% increase from the comparable period.\nOverall, the segment's operating margins improved to 10.1% for the quarter.\nHigher spreads in the business drove the operating income improvement.\nNow let's discuss prepared foods.\nQuarterly sales reached $2.3 billion, a 10% increase from the previous year's same period.\nTotal volume decreased, with strength in retail and continued foodservice recovery outweighed by labor and supply chain challenges.\nSales growth outpaced volume growth due to inflation-justified pricing.\nDuring the quarter, retail core business lines maintained market share, driven by consumer demand for our brands and strong team execution.\nThe segment's operating margins were 8% or $186 million for the first quarter.\nThe decline in segment operating margins compared to last year's same quarter was due to significant increases in raw material and other input costs that we couldn't fully recover through pricing during the quarter.\nRaw material costs, logistics, ingredients, packaging, and labor have increased our production costs.\nOur pricing lagged behind inflation, but we expect to recover cost increases during fiscal 2022.\nIn addition to pricing, we've implemented productivity, revenue management, and commercial spend optimization initiatives while ensuring continued brand equity development through marketing and trade support.\nNow let's examine the chicken segment's results.\nQuarterly sales were $3.9 billion, a 37% increase.\nVolumes improved 3.6% due to strong consumer demand and increased live production.\nOur teams have focused on streamlining plants to deliver higher volumes, and we expect substantial volume improvements in fiscal 2022 as hatch recovers and we continue to seek ways to operate our plants more efficiently.\nAverage sales price improved around 20% in the first quarter compared to last year's same period.\nThis increase is due to favorable product mix and price recovery to offset cost inflation.\nWe've made significant progress in shifting our pricing mechanisms toward more variable structures and are now seeing the benefits.\nWe restructured our pricing strategies based on our fiscal 2021 experience to ensure flexibility in responding to market and inflationary conditions.\nChicken delivered adjusted operating income of $117 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, representing a 3% operating margin.\nOperating income in the quarter was negatively impacted by $185 million in higher feed ingredient costs.\nOur capital allocation approach focuses on building financial strength, investing in our business, and returning cash to shareholders.\nTo build financial strength and flexibility, we used improved earnings to retire debt in fiscal 2021 and expect to do the same this year.\nContinued earnings strength this quarter has further improved our leverage ratio to 1.1 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA.\nInvesting in organic and inorganic growth remains an important priority and will help Tyson increase production capacity and market capabilities.\nThis will support strong returns for our shareholders.\nWe are committed to returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks.\nWe ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet and continued capital allocation flexibility.\nWe are maintaining our total company sales guidance of $49 billion to $51 billion but expect to perform at the upper end of the range.\nWe still anticipate 2% to 3% year-over-year volume growth as we optimize our existing footprint and run our plants at full capacity.\nIn chicken, we expect to achieve 5% to 7% run rate profitability by mid-year and full-year margins in the same range.\nPrepared foods is expected to deliver margins of 7% to 9% during fiscal 2022, likely at the upper end of the range.\nWe maintain our beef AOI margin at 9% to 11% but expect to perform at the upper end of the range.\nWe anticipate a stronger first half of the year as industry and labor conditions are expected to normalize partway through the year.\nIn pork, we expect similar performance to fiscal 2021, with margins between 5% and 7%.\nWe anticipate the first quarter to be the strongest due to normal seasonality.\nIn international/other, we expect margins of 2% to 3% as capacity expansions and strong global demand support volume growth and improved profitability.\nWe anticipate capex spending of approximately $2 billion during fiscal 2022 to pursue projects with strong return profiles.\nWe now expect lower net interest expense due to lower anticipated average debt balances during the fiscal year.\nOur expectations for productivity savings and tax rate changes remain unchanged.\nWe expect net leverage to remain well below two times net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA, providing flexibility for inorganic investment and additional cash returns to shareholders throughout the year.\nWe've had a strong start to the fiscal year with a great team, growing product demand, strong portfolio diversity, and the differentiated asset footprint needed for market success.\nWe set ambitious goals at our Investor Day and expect to achieve them.\nSummary: ",

communities.\nI am profoundly appreciative of all our global employees, many of whom come to our facilities daily to develop, evaluate, manufacture, and distribute our products.\nThe team's adaptability, ingenuity, and determination are evident in our actions to secure our facilities and implement remote work policies.\nSimultaneously, we are sustaining the crucial aspects of our manufacturing operations.\nThis is all essential, given The Toro Company's status as a vital business.\nTo support our communities, we initiated a special COVID-19 giving program called Together We Can Do More.\nThrough this initiative, we make direct donations and match all employee contributions to COVID-19 relief efforts.\nFurthermore, The Toro Foundation donated $500,000 to organizations aiding families and communities most directly affected by the pandemic.\nAcknowledging the financial strain on our employees and their families, we broadened the availability of the Melrose/Hoffman Employee Critical Need Fund.\nAdditional voluntary contributions were made to this fund by our leadership team and Board of Directors.\nTo quote our legendary former Chairman and CEO, Ken Melrose, who sadly passed away last month, everyone has the capacity to contribute to achieving the company's goals.\nIf you unleash that potential, success will naturally follow.\nThese words carry significant weight coming from Ken, who successfully guided The Toro Company through some of its most challenging periods.\nI will now shift to our business and financial review.\nFrom a business standpoint, we have focused on maintaining sufficient liquidity, expanding our market position, and balancing short-term and long-term objectives.\nOur results this quarter showed net sales of $929 million, a 3.4% decrease from the previous year, primarily due to reduced Professional segment retail demand resulting from COVID-19.\nWe reported adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.92, a 21.4% decrease from the previous year.\nTo provide specific information by business segments, the Professional segment's total net sales were $661 million, an 8.6% decrease.\nSales benefited from additional contributions from the Charles Machine Works and Venture Products acquisitions.\nThis quarter marked the one-year anniversary of the Charles Machine Works acquisition.\nWe are fortunate to have this business and its employees as part of our company.\nCharles Machine Works added scale and diversification to our portfolio, provided access to new markets, and created additional opportunities for synergy and value creation across the company.\nWe are on track to meet or exceed our stated synergy targets.\nOffsetting the gains from acquisitions were declines in most of our Professional businesses due to weak retail demand caused by COVID-19.\nThe declines were most prominent in commercial golf and grounds, which saw fewer shipments of turf equipment and irrigation products.\nThis was driven by budget deferrals at golf courses and municipalities, landscape contractor businesses which had fewer shipments as our channel partners aligned field inventory levels with reduced retail demand, and rental specialty and underground construction businesses which have experienced reduced sales volumes due to the global economic slowdown and its impact on the construction and oil and gas markets.\nIt's important to note that the Professional segment performance was in line with our expectations of modest growth until mid-March.\nIn April, we experienced additional and significant declines in most of our Professional markets.\nWe typically don't discuss the current quarter in our earnings calls.\nHowever, we recognize that this quarter is unique.\nSo, we'll provide some insight into what occurred in May.\nFor the Professional segment, it was largely a story of new equipment purchase deferrals and a focus on service and repair.\nWe're seeing ongoing challenges across golf and grounds, landscape contractor, and rental specialty and underground construction businesses.\nThese challenges stem more from lower budgets and deferred purchases than from temporary facility closures.\nFor golf, most play has resumed and demand for rounds has been strong.\nHowever, lower food and beverage and event revenue has negatively affected club budgets, putting pressure on new equipment purchases.\nFor our municipal grounds customers, budgets have been reduced or redirected to non-ground support, resulting in decreased equipment demand.\nThe repair and defer story is similar with landscape contractors.\nHowever, with the easing of stay-at-home restrictions, there were some improvements in these categories starting in late May.\nIn rental, specialty and underground construction, 5G infrastructure and broadband spending increased slightly in May with high demand for system capacity due to stay-at-home orders.\nUnderground infrastructure, rehabilitation and repair projects remained steady.\nHowever, this is being offset by continued construction and oil and gas project weakness, reduced capital spending from national rental accounts resulting in new equipment purchase deferrals, and lower dealer retail.\nIn the Residential segment, sales increased by 12.9% in the second quarter.\nThis was primarily driven by additional shipments to our expanded mass retail channel and strong retail demand.\nSome of the demand drivers were favorable spring weather, new products, and consumers focusing on home and garden improvements during stay-at-home orders.\nOur product sales through captive and partnered e-commerce sites increased significantly in the second quarter.\nFor May, Residential segment momentum continued, driven by the same trends.\nRegarding operations, all of our facilities are currently open, with some operating at reduced capacity.\nDuring the second quarter, some sites closed temporarily due to government orders or to manage inventory levels.\nWe will adjust production to match customer demand, follow government directives, and prioritize team safety.\nThere were no supply chain disruptions during the quarter.\nOur financial position remains robust with a healthy balance sheet and sufficient liquidity.\nWe implemented measures this quarter to ensure adequate cash reserves given the current economic situation.\nFor the rest of fiscal 2020, we are implementing company-wide salary reductions including leadership, canceling merit increases, and suspending discretionary retirement plan contributions.\nWe also cut expenses and limited new hiring to essential positions only.\nWe have maintained jobs and kept key employees despite these measures.\nWe continue to realize benefits from efficiency initiatives and synergies resulting from recent acquisitions.\nWe have experience navigating economic challenges and know how to leverage our strengths.\nOur organizational culture and management approach are well-suited to handle external uncertainties.\nWhile some factors are beyond our control, our diverse portfolio and adaptability allow us to adjust to changing conditions while maintaining long-term growth and cash flow.\nWe remain committed to investing in the future for all stakeholders' benefit.\nThe Toro Company offers a balanced range of products that boost customer productivity across different seasons.\nThe company's strong financial position allows for effective capital allocation across various options like product development, acquisitions, dividends, debt reduction and share buybacks.\nThe second quarter was no different.\nAlthough COVID-19 impacted our results, we adapted our operations and continued to progress.\nWe achieved net sales of $929 million this quarter, down 3.4% from the same period last fiscal year.\nEarnings per diluted share were $0.91 for the quarter compared to $1.07 in the previous year.\nAdjusted earnings per diluted share were $0.92, a 21.4% decrease from the second quarter of fiscal 2019.\nFor the first half of fiscal 2020, net sales grew by 8.4%.\nEarnings per diluted share were $1.55 compared to $1.62 in the first half of fiscal 2019.\nYear-to-date adjusted earnings per diluted share were $1.56 versus $1.69 a year ago.\nBefore discussing segment results, I'll address our liquidity situation.\nIn March, we secured a three-year term loan for $190 million.\nThis loan refinanced our revolving credit facility borrowings used for the Venture Products acquisition that closed on March 2.\nWith this new term loan, the company now has about $800 million in liquidity, including $200 million in cash and cash equivalents and roughly $600 million available under our revolving credit facility.\nWe have no major debt maturities until April 2022.\nWe maintain close communication with our banking partners and monitor credit markets closely.\nOur receivables collection remains consistent with last year's trends.\nThese factors give us confidence in our ability to withstand the current and potentially prolonged period of economic uncertainty.\nI'd like to provide more details on the actions we've taken to maintain the company's strength given the unprecedented speed and severity of the pandemic.\nFrom a demand perspective, we've implemented business continuity plans and worked to ensure product availability in areas with strong demand, such as our Residential segment.\nWe've also reduced production in areas with weaker demand.\nAs Rick mentioned, we've taken steps to align costs with near-term demand and will continue seeking ways to make our cost structure more flexible and competitive.\nMeanwhile, we're focusing on maintaining productivity and synergy initiatives driven by recent acquisitions and extended across the company.\nNow, let's review the segment results.\nIn the second quarter, Professional segment net sales decreased by 8.6% to $661 million.\nThe top line benefited from the Charles Machine Works and Venture Products acquisitions, which together added $142 million in incremental net sales.\nProfessional segment sales declined compared to the second quarter of 2019 due to lower shipments caused by COVID-related demand reduction.\nUntil mid-March and the impact of COVID-19, sales were on track for modest growth in line with our expectations.\nWe saw a slight sales decline in the second half of March and a more significant reduction in April compared to the previous year's performance.\nFor the year-to-date period of fiscal 2020, net sales increased by 6.6% compared to the same period in fiscal 2019.\nProfessional segment operating earnings for the second quarter decreased by 29.2% to $106 million, reflecting a 460 basis point decline in segment operating earnings as a percentage of sales.\nThis was primarily due to manufacturing variances resulting from COVID-19 related facility closures and social distancing measures, increased marketing, engineering, and administrative costs from the Charles Machine Works and Venture Products acquisitions, higher warranty expenses, and unfavorable product mix.\nThese factors were partially offset by favorable net price realizations, productivity and synergy gains, lower commodity and tariff costs, and decreased incentive compensation expenses.\nYear-to-date Professional segment operating earnings declined by 12.3% compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year.\nProfessional segment operating earnings as a percentage of sales decreased by 360 basis points to 16.6%.\nResidential segment net sales for the second quarter increased by 12.9% to $262 million, primarily driven by increased shipments of zero-turn riding and walk power mowers to the expanded mass retail channel, as well as strong retail demand.\nYear-to-date fiscal 2020 net sales increased by 13.4% compared to the same period in fiscal 2019.\nResidential segment operating earnings rose by 68.5% to $37 million.\nThis represents a 470 basis point year-over-year increase in segment operating earnings to 14.2% of sales.\nThis improvement was largely due to productivity and synergy gains, lower commodity and tariff costs, reduced freight costs, and SG&A leverage.\nThese benefits were partially offset by unfavorable manufacturing variances and higher warranty expenses.\nYear-to-date Residential segment operating earnings increased by 67.2% to $58.7 million.\nAs a percentage of sales, segment earnings increased by 440 basis points to 13.7%.\nRegarding our overall operating results, we reported a gross margin of 33% for the second quarter, a decrease of 40 basis points from the prior year period.\nExcluding acquisition-related charges and one-time costs associated with the inventory writedown of the Toro branded underground business, adjusted gross margin decreased by 100 basis points to 33.4%.\nThe decrease in adjusted gross margin was primarily due to manufacturing variances caused by production downtime and inefficiencies resulting from COVID-19 related closures, as well as product mix with higher Residential segment net sales compared to Q2 of 2019.\nThese factors were partially offset by productivity and synergy gains, favorable net price realizations in our Professional segment, and lower commodity and tariff costs.\nDuring the initial half of fiscal 2020, the gross margin reached 35.1%, an improvement from 34.3% in the previous year's corresponding period\nThe adjusted gross margin stood at 35.3%, up from 34.9% in the first six months of fiscal 2019\nIn the quarter, SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales rose by 40 basis points to 19.5%, primarily due to increased marketing and engineering expenses from Professional segment acquisitions and higher warranty costs\nThese expense increases were partly mitigated by reduced incentive compensation and lower transaction and integration expenses\nFor the first half of fiscal 2020, SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales reached 22.3%, a 130 basis point increase from the previous year\nThe second quarter saw operating earnings as a percentage of net sales decline by 80 basis points to 13.5%\nAdjusted operating earnings as a percentage of net sales dropped by 240 basis points to 14%\nIn the first half of fiscal 2020, operating earnings as a percentage of net sales were 12.8%, down from 13.3% a year earlier\nAdjusted operating earnings as a percentage of net sales for the first six months of fiscal 2020 decreased to 13.1% from 14.7% in the previous year\nInterest expenses increased by $2 million and $5.4 million for the second quarter and year-to-date, respectively, compared to the previous year\nThe rise in interest expenses was attributed to higher debt related to Professional segment acquisitions\nThe company anticipates interest expenses of approximately $34 million for the full year\nThe effective tax rate for the second quarter was 18.9%, while the adjusted effective tax rate was 20%\nFor the first half of fiscal 2020, the effective tax rate was 18.8%, and the adjusted effective tax rate was 20.4%\nThe company expects an adjusted effective tax rate of about 20.5% for the full year\nShifting focus to the balance sheet and cash flow\nAccounts receivable amounted to $400 million\nThis represents a 6.6% decrease from the previous year, primarily due to lower Professional segment sales at the end of the second quarter, caused by reduced demand from COVID-19\nThe decrease was partially offset by increased Residential segment sales to the expanded mass retail channel and additional receivables from the Venture Products acquisition\nInventory increased by 16.8% to $714 million compared to the previous year, mainly due to higher finished goods in the Professional segment resulting from COVID-19 related sales reduction, increased raw materials and work in process due to production downtime, and additional inventories from Venture Products\nAccounts payable decreased by 16.4% to $327 million compared to the previous year\nThis reduction was primarily due to decreased material purchases to align production levels with reduced sales volume\nThe decline in purchases was partially offset by incremental payables from Venture Products\nThe company anticipates depreciation and amortization for fiscal 2020 to be around $100 million, including approximately $3 million of fair value step-up related to acquired inventory from Venture Products\nCapital expenditures are now estimated at $80 million, lower than the previous expectation of $100 million\nFree cash flow for the quarter was lower than the previous year, mainly due to decreased net earnings, lower accounts payable, and higher inventory\nThe company's disciplined capital allocation strategy involves investing in organic and M&A growth opportunities, maintaining an effective capital structure, and returning cash to shareholders\nThe focus on near-term liquidity has reinforced the company's capital allocation priorities for the year\nFollowing the Venture Products acquisition, the company will continue to prioritize debt repayments to manage its leverage target, curtail share repurchases for the year, and consider strategically compelling acquisitions\nThe company declared its regular quarterly dividend in May\nBased on the current outlook and strong financial position, the company expects to maintain its dividend\nDue to the numerous and evolving COVID-19 related factors discussed and potential future developments, the company cannot predict the impact on its businesses and financial results\nHowever, the company anticipates the most significant year-over-year sales and earnings per share percentage declines in the third quarter of fiscal 2020\nNegative year-over-year fourth quarter sales and earnings per share growth are also expected\nThese expectations assume continued changes in customer behavior, including lower capital outlays and cash preservation, primarily in the Professional segment\nOn a positive note, the company's products have a natural replacement life, suggesting net sales will recover in future periods\nFactors that could impact these expectations include the company's ability to continue operations or adjust production schedules due to governmental actions, supplier risk and the ability to obtain materials and components in a timely manner at anticipated costs, and prolonged economic stress affecting customer liquidity and buying patterns\nThe company anticipates an easing of these pressures as it enters fiscal 2021\nIn summary, the company has taken necessary steps to position itself for growth entering fiscal 2021, including preserving jobs, lowering costs, strengthening its financial position, serving partners well, and continuing to invest in technology and innovation\nThe company remains prepared to take further actions to serve customers in various potential economic scenarios\nDespite limited near-term visibility, measures have been taken to ensure a solid financial position moving forward\nThe company is confident in its ability to continue serving global customers throughout and beyond the pandemic\nLooking ahead, the company is optimistic about exciting opportunities, with investments in alternative power, smart connected products, and robotic and autonomous technologies driving a new cycle of innovative products across markets\nThe company continues to expand its portfolio of battery-powered products as customers seek convenience and reduced emissions\nIt is expected that customers who deferred new equipment purchases will return to historic buying patterns as the economy improves\nIn construction, the buildout of 5G and rural broadband is expected to benefit sales of underground equipment\nIn golf and grounds, the company will continue to innovate to increase productivity and solve customer challenges\nThe company continues to support contractors with an expanded line of high productivity equipment solutions\nContinued homeowner interest in home and garden improvement is expected\nThe company has an exciting array of new products, including an expanded portfolio of 60-volt solutions, refreshed brand content and marketing, and a new channel partner broadening its reach\nThe company's strategic priorities remain focused on accelerating profitable growth, driving productivity and operational excellence, and empowering people\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Prior to commencing, I should note that we'll be addressing future projections and anticipations during our discussion today.\nJoining us for today's conference are Scott Donnelly, Textron's CEO and chairman, along with Frank Connor, our CFO.\nTextron's quarterly revenue was $3.7 billion, representing a decrease of $368 million compared to the previous year.\nIn the fourth quarter of this year, we recorded $23 million in pre-tax extraordinary charges, primarily associated with restructuring initiatives in the industrial and Textron Aviation sectors, equivalent to $0.07 per share after tax.\nWe also acknowledged a one-time favorable tax advantage related to the TRU Canada sale, amounting to $0.04 per share.\nAfter excluding extraordinary charges and the one-time favorable benefit, the adjusted net income was $1.06 per share, compared to $1.11 in the fourth quarter of the previous year.\nManufacturing cash flow before pension contributions amounted to $467 million, a decrease of $183 million from the fourth quarter of the previous year.\nFor the entire year, revenues totaled $11.7 billion, down from $13.6 billion in the previous year.\nThe adjusted net income was $2.07 per share, in contrast to $3.74 the previous year.\nManufacturing cash flow before pension contributions totaled $596 million, compared to $642 million in the previous year.\nOur company concluded the year with robust operational performance in the fourth quarter, as we observed margin improvements in Systems, Industrial, and Bell, leading to an increase in Textron's manufacturing margin to 8.8% despite lower revenues.\nAt Bell, margins of 12.6% increased by 30 basis points compared to the previous year, despite reduced military revenues and commercial volume.\nWe delivered 57 commercial helicopters, a decrease from 76 in the fourth quarter of the previous year.\nIn the military sector, Japan officially commenced V-22 flight operations in November.\nThis contributes to the expansion of the global fleet of operational aircraft, which has accumulated over 560,000 flight hours.\nRegarding Future Vertical Lift, Bell commemorated the third anniversary of the V-280's inaugural flight in December, with the aircraft now having logged more than 200 flight hours.\nArmy leadership and Congress have been highly supportive of Future Vertical Lift, and we anticipate this support will persist under the new administration.\nIn December, the U.S. Army provided the preliminary RFP for the FLRAA program for review and feedback.\nThe Army continues to expect a down-select and FLRAA program award in mid-2022.\nAt Systems, revenues decreased primarily due to lower volume in the TRU Simulation + Training business.\nIn November, Systems announced the sale of its commercial air transport simulator business to CAE.\nThis transaction was finalized in January.\nDuring the quarter, ATAC secured the renewal of the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps flight, fighter jet training services program.\nThis contract expands the scope of services we currently provide for the program and is valued at up to $440 million over the next five years.\nAdditionally in the quarter, unmanned systems was awarded a $66 million contract from the U.S. Army for 36 Shadow aircraft.\nThe Shadow platform has now accumulated over 1.2 million flight hours globally.\nRevenues declined primarily due to decreased demand in the ground support equipment business within Specialized Vehicles.\nFor Kautex, the automotive production outlook has steadily improved since its low point in May, and demand from our customers continued to increase in the fourth quarter as revenues approached their previous year's levels.\nTransitioning to Textron Aviation's performance\nThe quarter saw a decline in revenue, mainly due to reduced jet deliveries and aftermarket activity\nWe delivered fewer jets compared to last year, but slightly more commercial turboprops\nTextron Aviation introduced the new King Air 360, delivering eight units, and announced the King Air 260\nThe Cessna SkyCourier program is advancing, with three aircraft undergoing certification testing\nOver 400 flight hours have been completed in the test program, with the aircraft on track for service entry in late 2021\n2020 presented numerous operational challenges, but our teams responded admirably\nOur focus on working capital and cost management resulted in strong manufacturing cash flow for the year\nOur defense businesses maintained operations, fulfilling customer obligations and achieving strong results\nDespite temporary shutdowns and market disruptions, our commercial side delivered strong fourth-quarter results, building momentum for 2021\nWe anticipate revenues of approximately $12.5 billion for Textron's 2021 fiscal year\nAviation expects growth from increased aircraft deliveries, new product launches, and higher aftermarket revenues due to increased fleet usage\nSystems projects higher revenues and improved margins, driven by growth in ATAC and Marine and Land Systems\nBell anticipates solid margins despite lower military and commercial revenues, while investing in Future Vertical Lift\nIndustrial expects revenue growth and margin improvement at Kautex as automotive demand recovers to pre-COVID levels\nTextron Specialized Vehicles anticipates revenue and margin growth as we expand our powersports business with Bass Pro Shops\nWe forecast adjusted earnings per share between $2.70 and $2.90\nManufacturing cash flow before pension contributions is expected to range from $600 million to $700 million\nQuarterly segment profit decreased by $16 million compared to last year, with revenues dropping by $368 million\nTextron Aviation's revenues fell 10% to $1.6 billion, mainly due to lower Citation jet and aftermarket volumes\nThe segment's profit declined to $108 million, primarily because of reduced volume and mix changes\nBell's revenues decreased to $871 million, mainly due to lower military and commercial volumes\nBell's segment profit dropped by $8 million, largely due to lower volume, partially offset by favorable performance adjustments\nTextron Systems' revenues decreased to $357 million, primarily due to lower volume at TRU Simulation and Training\nSystems' segment profit increased by $16 million, mainly due to improved performance\nThe segment's backlog reached $2.6 billion at the quarter's end.\nIndustrial earnings decreased to $866 million, dropping $61 million from the previous year, mainly due to lower demand in the Specialized Vehicles' ground support equipment sector.\nProfits in the segment rose to $55 million, a 25% increase from Q4 2019, primarily because of favorable pricing, inflation effects, and improved performance, which was partially counterbalanced by reduced volume and mix changes.\nThe Finance segment generated $13 million in revenue and $2 million in profit.\nBelow segment profit, corporate costs totaled $50 million, while interest expenses amounted to $36 million.\nThe quarter saw $23 million in pre-tax special charges related to restructuring efforts.\nFollowing strong cash performance, the year concluded with roughly $2.3 billion in cash on the balance sheet.\nThe $2.3 billion cash reserve is higher than usual, including a $500 million prefunding for 2021 debt maturities.\nDuring the quarter, $350 million of floating rate notes due in November were paid off, along with $362 million of outstanding borrowings on corporate-owned life insurance policies drawn in Q1 for additional liquidity.\nThe share repurchase program was reactivated in the quarter, with approximately $129 million of shares bought back.\nTextron Aviation is projected to have increased revenues of about $4.5 billion, reflecting higher jet and turboprop deliveries and improved aftermarket sales.\nThe segment margin is anticipated to be around 5.5%, due to higher volume and increased production.\nBell is expected to see slightly lower revenues of about $3.1 billion, due to reduced military revenues from lower H-1 production and aftermarket volume, as well as fewer commercial deliveries.\nA margin of about 12.5% is forecasted, mainly reflecting decreased military and commercial revenues and increased R&D investments in FLRAA and FARA.\nSystems is estimated to have higher 2021 revenues of about $1.4 billion.\nThe segment margin is projected to be around 12.5%.\nIndustrial segment revenues are expected to reach about $3.4 billion, showing higher revenues at Kautex and Textron Specialized Vehicles.\nThe segment margin is anticipated to be approximately 6%.\nThe finance segment is forecasted to generate a profit of about $10 million.\nWe estimate 2021 pension income to be about $30 million compared to a pension cost of $33 million in the previous year.\nThe 2021 pension reflects a strong 17.4% return on pension assets in 2020 and a change in the amortization period for accumulated actuarial losses for one domestic plan, resulting in a longer amortization period.\nThese positive changes are offset by a 75-basis point decrease in the discount rate to 2.7% and a 50-basis point reduction in the estimated long-term asset return to 7.25%.\nR&D expenses are expected to increase to about $600 million from $545 million in 2020.\nCapital expenditures are estimated to rise to about $400 million from $317 million last year.\nBelow the segment line, we project about $120 million in corporate expenses, $135 million in interest expenses, and a full-year effective tax rate of approximately 18%.\nThe full-year 2021 adjusted earnings per share guidance is $2.70 to $2.90, excluding $20 million to $30 million of pre-tax special charges for completing the previously announced restructuring plan and a pre-tax gain of about $10 million from the sale of TRU Canada.\nOur outlook assumes an average share count of about 227 million shares as we continue to allocate most of our free cash to share repurchases in 2021.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Let me begin by acknowledging our associates at Optum and UnitedHealthcare for their outstanding performance throughout 2021 and creating momentum as we enter this year.\nTwo key aspects of our growth strategy, namely accelerating patient transitions to Optum-led value-based care and robust United Healthcare growth in Medicare Advantage, are progressing in line with the projections we shared at our recent investor meeting.\nThese developments, along with overall enterprise performance, reinforce our confidence in advancing our growth strategies and maintaining our long-term 13% to 16% earnings per share growth target.\nReflecting on 2021, we see a narrative of accelerating growth, strong collaboration between Optum and UnitedHealthcare and external partners, which facilitated expansion in commercial and government markets, sparked innovation, introduced integrated products and services, and significantly increased participation in value-based care models.\nIn the past year, we utilized our technological capabilities to assist medical professionals and hospitals in better serving their patients and communities.\nWe also intensified our focus on consumers, striving to enhance the overall experience.\nCollectively, these initiatives helped us add over $30 billion in revenue for the year, surpassing our initial forecast by approximately $10 billion.\nSimilar growth can be anticipated in the coming year.\nWe observe an increasing demand for integration to unify the fragmented healthcare system, harness market innovations, improve alignment of incentives for providers, payers, and consumers, and organize the system around value.\nOur vision is for a healthcare system that is more interconnected, informed, compassionate, and responsive to individual needs.\nAt our investor conference, we outlined five key growth areas and differentiated experiences across our portfolio, which will guide our strategy this year and beyond.\nThe first focus is on care delivery, particularly value-based care, which for UnitedHealth Group extends beyond primary care to include our expanding behavioral, home, ambulatory, and virtual care capabilities.\nOur second growth area involves health benefits, enhancing the quality, innovation, and consumer appeal of our offerings while implementing our value-based strategy.\nWe begin 2022 with strong consumer growth in Medicare Advantage, progress in Medicaid, and increasing momentum in our commercial business.\nOur major partnerships nationwide assist health systems in improving their performance and returns, ultimately supporting their missions.\nWe're excited about the potential to extend these comprehensive, tailored solutions to more system partners in 2022 and beyond.\nThe fourth area is health financial services, aiming to significantly improve the health payment sector by streamlining and simplifying transactions for providers, payers, and consumers while reducing friction and increasing speed and convenience.\nLastly, we focus on pharmacy services, where people interact most frequently with the healthcare system.\nWe aim to leverage our extensive pharmacy services and data capabilities, integrating medical, pharmacy, and behavioral services to provide comprehensive care, support new drug discoveries, and promote value-based care models.\nIn conclusion, we enter 2022 with increased confidence in our ability to achieve the objectives we set forth in late November.\nI'd like to provide additional details on our primary growth priority: value-based care, our preparations, investments, and our vision for its near-future implementation.\nThis initiative has been in development for a decade.\nSignificant operational groundwork and investment were necessary to support the half-million new patients for whom OptumHealth will become accountable in 2022.\nSuccessful execution requires extensive planning, investment, and development.\nThis has become a distinctive competency of our enterprise, which we can now apply on a larger scale.\nLet's explore what's involved in preparing for a fully accountable arrangement.\nInvestments can be substantial.\nIn 2021, we spent over $100 million in preparatory expenses.\nThis preparation involves three main areas: training medical staff, upgrading technology and data systems, and coordinating networks.\nThe initial focus is on educating doctors.\nThis process begins more than a year in advance.\nIt's crucial to equip physicians with the necessary resources and information to change their approach to patient care.\nThey start addressing their patients' overall health long before taking on more responsibility.\nWe've found this shift from traditional fee-for-service practices to be essential but sometimes challenging.\nIn addition to education, we increase our workforce by hiring more doctors, nurses, and other healthcare professionals to meet our business needs.\nThe second area concentrates on implementing technology systems and gathering information to support patient care and effective clinical management.\nThis includes developing patient portals, utilization management systems, and reporting tools for teams to manage effectively.\nThe final area involves planning and coordinating networks to ensure comprehensive clinical oversight and true continuity of care.\nThis includes identifying high-need patients, ensuring smooth transitions to intensive clinical care services that improve health, and quickly connecting patients with personal care navigators to help with complex health needs, appointment scheduling, and timely medication support from day one.\nThese fundamental preparations and investments have been crucial in achieving strong results across various locations and practices we've transitioned.\nWe anticipate that this expertise will be valuable as we transition even larger groups of patients in the coming years.\nBefore passing the discussion to John, I'd like to provide an update on how COVID has affected our operations.\nSimilar to other companies, we've experienced slightly higher turnover rates and more unexpected absences.\nWe prepared for this situation by increasing our recruitment capacity and significantly improving our digital capabilities to enhance customer experience and reduce call volumes.\nAs a result, during the first two weeks of 2022, typically our busiest period, we were able to meet the needs of our patients and customers.\nSimultaneously, we quickly responded to the federal mandate for free COVID tests for consumers, which was a highly complex task.\nWith only four days' notice, UnitedHealthcare developed a digital customer experience for easy reimbursement and established partnerships with Walmart and Rite Aid, eliminating upfront costs for consumers at the point of purchase.\nWe anticipate more partnerships in the near future.\nLooking ahead, we believe we have the appropriate capacity to execute our business priorities and meet our customers' expectations.\nI'll begin by elaborating on Dirk's comments regarding the COVID impacts we're observing.\nIn recent weeks, inpatient hospitalization rates for our members are comparable to January 2021 levels, despite national COVID case rates being about four times higher.\nFor those requiring inpatient care, the severity appears to be lower, as we're seeing shorter hospital stays compared to the earlier period.\nConcurrently, we're noticing familiar patterns in care activity related to other periods of high infection rates experienced over the past two years.\nFor instance, in early January, we're observing a slowdown in primary care, elective visits, and procedural volumes.\nRecent activity shows primary care visits have decreased by about 10%, with an even higher decline rate in specialist visits.\nOur main priority remains ensuring individuals receive necessary medical attention when required.\nLet's now examine our specific business results.\nOptumHealth saw a 30% increase in revenue per customer in 2021, primarily due to the growing number of patients we serve under value-based agreements.\nIn line with our late November projections, we had a robust beginning to the year and still anticipate adding 500,000 new patients in accountable value-based relationships, benefiting from years of preparatory work.\nOptumInsight's earnings increased by 25% in 2021, with operating margins nearing 28% for the year.\nWe finished the year with a revenue backlog of $22.4 billion, which is $2.2 billion more than the previous year.\nOur expanding partnerships with health systems have been a key factor in this growth, and we expect these collaborations to continue growing in 2022 and beyond.\nOptumRx earnings grew 6% for the year, driven by ongoing expansion of our pharmacy services businesses, supply chain initiatives, and effective cost management, as well as strong customer retention.\nFurthermore, we continue to observe the impact of OptumRx's shift towards a higher-value pharmacy care and specialty services orientation.\nTotal revenue for the year reached $223 billion, an 11% increase.\nAs mentioned, our 2022 Medicare Advantage membership growth outlook is very positive and aligns with the goals we set at our November investor conference.\nOf the up to 800,000 new members we will serve in 2022, approximately three-quarters will be in individual and group Medicare Advantage plans, with the remainder in dual special needs plans.\nGiven our steady progress in quality performance, we have the opportunity to enroll people in our newly rated five-star plans throughout the entire year.\nOur Medicaid membership outlook for 2022 continues to include an expectation that states will resume eligibility redeterminations, resulting in modest net attrition.\nIn January, we began serving Minnesota residents and continue to support Missouri's expansion this year, as well as renewed relationships with Ohio, Tennessee, and Nevada.\nThroughout the year, we will aim to expand upon the nearly 8 million individuals we serve across 31 states.\nWe ended 2021 with commercial membership about 200,000 people higher than the original outlook provided.\nThis momentum is driven by the strong response we're seeing to new innovative products we've discussed, such as NavigateNOW, which uses the Optum virtual network as a primary option.\nOur financial capabilities remain robust.\nFull-year 2021 cash flow from operations was $22.3 billion, or 1.3 times net income, about $2 billion above the initial outlook we shared a year ago.\nWe continue to anticipate our 2022 cash flow will approach $24 billion, about 1.2 times net income.\nWe concluded 2021 with a debt-to-total capital ratio of 38%.\nThese substantial financial resources allow us to accelerate our investments while maintaining our commitment to an increasing shareholder dividend and supporting our expected repurchase of between $5 billion and $6 billion of stock in 2022.\nOur 2022 adjusted earnings per share outlook of $21.10 to $21.60 aligns with the projection we offered seven weeks ago.\nFrom this perspective, and unlike the past two years, we expect the seasonal pattern to more closely resemble our historical experience, with slightly less than 50% of full-year earnings in the first half and the first two quarters being relatively equal.\nBefore we move to the Q&A session, I hope you've already sensed the strong confidence John, Dirk, and I share in this company's growth potential, based on the increasing number of people we're serving in value-based models, the deep relationships we're building with local health systems, our pharmacy capabilities, and the innovation and consumer focus driving growth across our government programs, individual and commercial businesses.\nAs demand for innovation and integrated solutions, products, and services continues to grow, we've never been better positioned to help unify the fragmented aspects of healthcare and create more value for those we aim to serve.\nPlease limit questions to one per caller.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:We are eager to talk about Vector Group dividing its operations through spinning off Douglas Elliman.\nToday, I'm joined by several key executives from Vector Group, Douglas Elliman Realty LLC, and Liggett Vector Brands.\nRon Bernstein, Senior Advisor to Liggett Vector Brands, will be available during the question and answer session.\nWe will then share the exciting news about our plan to spin off Vector Group's real estate brokerage business, including Douglas Elliman and its innovative PropTech investments, into a separate publicly traded company.\nWe have also submitted a Form 10 to the SEC.\nLet's begin with the financial results.\nAs of September 30, 2021, Vector Group's consolidated balance sheet remained robust.\nWe maintained ample liquidity with $524 million in cash and cash equivalents, including $159 million at Douglas Elliman and $133 million at Liggett.\nWe also held investment securities and partnership interests valued at $214 million as of September 30, 2021.\nNow let's look at Vector Group's consolidated operational results for the quarter ending September 30, 2021.\nVector Group's revenues increased to $652.6 million from $547.8 million in the same period last year, with a $125.7 million rise in the real estate segment partially offset by a $20.9 million decline in the tobacco segment.\nVector Group's net income rose to $48.9 million or $0.32 per diluted share, compared to $38.1 million or $0.25 per diluted share in Q3 2020.\nThe company's adjusted EBITDA increased to $116.5 million from $103.3 million in the previous year.\nAdjusted net income grew to $52.6 million or $0.34 per diluted share, up from $38.3 million or $0.25 per diluted share in the 2020 period.\nLet's review the results for the first nine months of 2021, ending September 30.\nVector Group's revenues climbed to $1.93 billion from $1.45 billion in the same period of 2020.\nThe $478 million revenue increase resulted from a $500.4 million rise in the real estate segment, partially offset by a $22.5 million decline in the tobacco segment.\nVector Group's net income increased to $174.2 million or $1.13 per diluted share, up from $60.7 million or $0.39 per diluted share in the 2020 period.\nThe company's adjusted EBITDA rose to $355.1 million from $240 million in the previous year.\nAdjusted net income grew to $194.3 million or $1.26 per diluted share, compared to $106.9 million or $0.70 per diluted share in the 2020 period.\nNow let's look at the results for the 12 months ending September 30, 2021.\nVector Group reported revenues of $2.48 billion, net income of $206.4 million, and adjusted EBITDA of $44.8 million.\nLet's now examine our tobacco business financial results.\nLiggett continued its strong performance in Q3 2021, increasing both retail market share and operating income.\nEagle 20's continues to generate significantly higher margins, while Pyramid provides substantial profit and market presence, and we're pleased with the performance of our value brand, Montego, as we expand its distribution across targeted areas nationwide.\nAccording to Management Science Associates retail data, the discount category grew by about 80 basis points in Q3 compared to last year, now making up 26.5% of the total market versus 25.7% in the same period last year.\nAs the deep discount segment continues to offer attractive value to consumers, we expect down-trading trends to persist for the foreseeable future.\nWe're confident that our value-focused brand portfolio and broad distribution position us well to meet these changing market demands and drive profitable growth.\nNow let's review the combined tobacco financials for Liggett Group and Vector Tobacco.\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, revenues were $297.9 million and $895.9 million respectively, compared to $318.9 million and $918.4 million for the same periods in 2020.\nTobacco adjusted operating income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 was $91.8 million and $273.9 million, compared to $91.6 million and $240.2 million for the corresponding periods last year.\nIn the first three quarters of 2021, tobacco adjusted operating income surpassed our full-year 2019 figures, which was a record at that time.\nLiggett's Q3 earnings increase was primarily due to higher gross profit margins from increased pricing and promotional spending efficiencies, offset by lower wholesale volumes and higher Master Settlement Agreement expenses.\nAs mentioned in our Q2 call, we anticipated pressure on our Q3 wholesale volumes following a significant inventory increase at the end of Q2, and we estimate about half of our year-over-year Q3 wholesale shipment declines were related to a reduction in wholesale inventories.\nAdditionally, significant reductions in our net MSA expense in Q3 2020 due to unusually strong industry volumes put extra pressure on our year-over-year earnings comparison.\nAccording to Management Science Associates, overall industry wholesale shipments for Q3 2021 decreased by 11.8% compared to last year, while Liggett's wholesale shipments declined by 11.6% for the same period.\nHowever, we believe retail shipments are a better indicator of underlying industry trends due to varying wholesaler buying patterns.\nLiggett's retail shipments for Q3 2021 declined 6.1% from the previous year, while industry retail shipments decreased 7% during the same period.\nAs a result, Liggett's Q3 retail share increased to 4.22% from 4.18% in the same period last year.\nSequentially, Liggett's retail share increased by 13 basis points in Q3 compared to Q2.\nIn summary, we're pleased with the operational and financial performance of our tobacco business.\nWhile we're always subject to industry, regulatory, and general market risks, we're confident that we have effective programs and infrastructure in place to keep our business operating efficiently and delivering both market share and profit growth from our value-based brand portfolio.\nBefore Howard discusses the spin-off transaction, let's review Douglas Elliman's financial performance for the three, nine, and last 12 months ended September 30, 2021.\nFor Q3 2021, Douglas Elliman reported $354.2 million in revenues, up from $208 million in the same period of 2020.\nDouglas Elliman reported net income of $25.1 million and adjusted EBITDA of $27.8 million in Q3, compared to $11.8 million and $14.1 million in the previous year.\nFor the first nine months of 2021, Douglas Elliman reported $1.02 billion in revenues, up from $506.5 million in the same period of 2020.\nDouglas Elliman reported net income of $82.2 million and adjusted EBITDA of $89.5 million for the first nine months of 2021, compared to a net loss of $62.2 million and adjusted EBITDA of $5.3 million in the 2020 period.\nThe net loss in the 2020 period included pre-tax charges for non-cash impairments of $58.3 million and pre-tax restructuring charges of $3.3 million.\nFor the 12 months ended September 30, 2021, Douglas Elliman reported $1.29 billion in revenues, $96.2 million of net income, and $106.2 million in adjusted EBITDA.\nAdditionally, Douglas Elliman reported closed sales of $47.7 billion in the 12 months ended September 30, 2021.\nDouglas Elliman's year-to-date results were driven by strong continued activity in all markets.\nBoth closed sales volume and revenues doubled compared to the same period in 2020.\nWe're particularly pleased with the continued strength of the South Florida market and the rebound of the New York City market during the first nine months of 2021.\nDouglas Elliman's gross margin or company dollar increased to $94.5 million in Q3 2021, up from $58.9 million in Q3 2020.\nFor the first nine months of 2021, Douglas Elliman's gross margin or company dollar increased to $274.1 million from $154.8 million in the same period of 2020.\nAs Douglas Elliman's revenues and gross margins significantly increased in 2021, we've discontinued certain expense reductions implemented in Q2 2020, including cuts to activity-based items such as advertising and discretionary compensation.\nThis team has extensive real estate expertise and a proven track record of driving growth.\nWe're very excited about this team because we've combined a strong management team from Vector with decades of public company management experience and a strong industry team from Douglas Elliman, which brings decades of real estate experience.\nLet's discuss our plan to separate Vector Group's real estate brokerage business and its PropTech investments into an independent publicly traded company.\nWe're doing this because we believe Douglas Elliman as a separate company will leverage its comprehensive suite of real estate solutions, industry-leading brand name, PropTech Investment arm New Valley Ventures LLC, and talented team of technology, marketing, and communication employees to unlock its growth potential.\nWe're doing this now, especially given current trends in the large and growing U.S. residential real estate industry, at a time when the size of our business has reached a critical mass, positioning us well to succeed in the market as a stand-alone company.\nIt will also be able to access the capital markets and broaden its potential investor base, as well as use its pure-play stock for M&A purposes and provide incentive opportunities for its key talent.\nWe expect this transaction to create significant value for all of Douglas Elliman's key stakeholders: developers, clients, brokerage customers, employees, agents, and stockholders.\nSpecifically, we believe our presence in the most important primary luxury markets in the United States, our opportunities for continued growth, our diverse revenue streams, and our distinctive approach to technology will result in a higher earnings multiple.\nThis is planned as a tax-free spin-off of Douglas Elliman to Vector Group stockholders.\nUpon completion, the new company called Douglas Elliman Inc. will be a separate publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol DOUG.\nDouglas Elliman Inc. will consist of the brokerage, New Valley Ventures LLC, DE property management, DE development and marketing, DE title, DE mortgage, and portfolio as well.\nThe rationale for the spin-off is that Vector Group's two businesses, tobacco and real estate, operate in distinct markets and possess unique growth prospects and investment profiles.\nAs planned, Vector Group stockholders will receive one share of Spinco common stock for every two shares of Vector Group common stock held.\nWe also expect, subject to Board approval, that Spinco will initially pay a $0.05 per share quarterly dividend to holders of Douglas Elliman common stock, and if Vector were to continue its $0.20 per share quarterly dividend.\nDoug's Board will include Dick Lampen, myself, and five experienced executives from public and private companies who bring expertise in technology, law, and finance: Ron Kramer, Wilson White, Lynn Mestel, Michael Liebowitz and Mark Zeitchick.\nLet's examine Page 6 for a summary of Elliman's operations.\nEstablished in 1911, Douglas Elliman is a leading innovative residential brokerage firm in the United States.\nDouglas Elliman is a premier real estate brand known for luxury service and innovation, operating in high-end markets, primarily densely populated international finance and technology centers, as well as many second and third home markets, which DEDM.\nThese markets offer premium-priced housing inventory.\nWith its luxury-associated brand name and comprehensive suite of technology-enabled real estate services and investments, the focus element is well-positioned to capitalize on the attractive dynamics in the U.S. residential real estate market.\nAs an independent publicly traded company, Douglas Elliman will pursue profitable growth opportunities to increase shareholder value by expanding its geographic presence, adopting cutting-edge PropTech, investing in PropTech companies through New Valley Ventures, excelling in retaining and recruiting top talent, making acquisitions and aqui-hires, and improving operational efficiency.\nDouglas Elliman will also have more direct and efficient access to capital markets and a broader potential investor base.\nDouglas Elliman boasts a strong financial profile with $200 million in net cash and significant operating leverage. Currently, Douglas Elliman has about 6,600 agents and for the 12 months ending September 30, 2021, it had a gross transaction volume of $47.7 billion, revenue of $1.29 billion, and adjusted EBITDA of $106.2 million.\nPage 7 shows that Douglas Elliman is one of the largest residential brokerage firms in the New York metropolitan area, including New York City, Long Island, Westchester, and the Hamptons, and ranks sixth in the United States by sales value according to HousingWire.\nThis sixth-place ranking is among brokerages like Realogy, Berkshire Hathaway, and Compass, which have tens of thousands of agents compared to Elliman's 6,600.\nSince 2013, Douglas Elliman has expanded across Florida, California, Aspen and Snowmass in Colorado, Houston, Dallas and Austin in Texas, and Massachusetts including Boston, Cape Cod, Martha's Vineyard, and Nantucket.\nThe company can use Douglas Elliman's brand equity and reputation to grow in new, existing, and adjacent markets, and attract top agents who recognize and trust the Douglas Elliman name, all contributing to increased market share.\nA key distinction between Elliman and competitors like Realogy and Compass is our focus on leading, densely populated international finance and technology hubs with premium-priced housing inventory.\nThis differs from these two competitors, one of which is a multi-brand national franchise with less focused growth plans that include many markets throughout the country lacking these demographics.\nConsequently, Elliman's average price per transaction is significantly higher than our main competitors.\nThis is crucial because the luxury market offers attractive economics with strong commission rates, and is considered more recession-proof due to factors like ongoing migration to lower-tax states, the rise of remote work, and millennials entering the housing market with a tendency to buy.\nWe believe this creates significant growth potential for our business, not only in existing markets but in complementary ones as well.\nLet's look at Page 9 to review the investment highlights for Spinco.\nThe U.S. residential real estate market shows highly attractive growth dynamics.\nElliman's comprehensive suite of real estate solutions provides multiple revenue streams and opportunities to monetize agent relationships.\nDouglas Elliman is a leading brand with a presence in most major U.S. luxury markets.\nWe utilize cutting-edge technology to support agent recruitment, retention, and productivity.\nWe have a robust platform for continued and sustainable growth.\nThe independent Douglas Elliman will have a strong balance sheet and significant operating leverage.\nLastly, we have an experienced management team with extensive real estate expertise and a track record of driving growth.\nPage 10 highlights the attractive characteristics of the U.S. residential market.\nSince early 2020, U.S. homeowner equity has grown 17.6% to $23.6 trillion.\nNew and existing home sales in the U.S. are projected to reach about 7.4 million units in 2022, up from 6.9 million in 2021 and 6.5 million in 2020.\nThis is occurring amid low mortgage rates driving home sales, which are likely to remain relatively attractive even with some increases next year.\nThis is accompanied by increased mobility, driven by factors including continued migration to low-tax areas, as well as COVID-related factors such as greater remote work flexibility leading to increased demand for larger spaces and second homes.\nDouglas Elliman increasingly refers to buyers wanting multiple primary residences, with their second and third homes having all the amenities and space desired for full-time living.\nPage 11 shows another factor contributing to long-term demand in the residential market: millennials, the largest population cohort, are entering the housing market in large numbers as they reach family formation and peak home-buying age.\nMaking their first home purchases later than previous generations, they now form an important and growing part of the demand, and we expect them to prefer technology-focused firms like Douglas Elliman.\nThis strong demand combined with low inventory has led to significant price appreciation in many market sectors, including many of our luxury markets.\nFinally, agents continue to play a crucial role in residential real estate transactions, despite various agentless models like iBuying.\nThese represent a very small portion of the market, with agents involved in approximately 90% of all residential transactions.\nReal estate transactions are complex, and agents help facilitate their successful completion.\nPage 12 shows that Douglas Elliman's comprehensive suite of real estate solutions provides multiple revenue streams in addition to our residential brokerage business.\nOur existing portfolio of ancillary real estate services enhances client experience and drives revenue and earnings growth, with opportunities to accelerate growth through investments and acquisitions.\nThese additional revenue streams include the Douglas Elliman development sales and marketing platform, which strengthens Elliman's position in the luxury real estate segment.\nLed by industry leader Susan de Franca, the new development division is sought after by well-known real estate developers, offering expertise from project inception to completion, including sales, leasing, and marketing for new developments in key U.S. markets.\nThe firm ranks among the most prominent marketing and sales firms in New York City and South Florida, with 75 in-house development professionals overseeing a $40 billion portfolio of buildings by renowned architects like Jean Nouvel and iconic brands including the Waldorf Astoria, the St Regis, and the Ritz-Carlton.\nThrough a strategic global alliance with Knight Frank Residential, the world's largest privately-owned property consultancy, Douglas Elliman new development benefits from immediate opportunities to market properties to international audiences.\nIn new development sales and marketing, unlike our main competitors, Douglas Elliman employs a hybrid broker model where traditional residential real estate agents work alongside Douglas Elliman new development professionals, leveraging their extensive industry relationships for the benefit of developer clients.\nOur agents can market and sell high-profile developments that enhance their brands and provide additional commission revenue potential.\nWe believe this model gives our new development business a competitive edge while also increasing the appeal of the Douglas Elliman platform to current and prospective agents.\nOur premium residential property management business, Douglas Elliman Property Management, provides a full range of fee-based management services for about 360 properties representing approximately 56,500 units in New York City, Nassau County, Long Island City, and Westchester County.\nThe buildings we manage provide an important source of referrals for our agents through our building specialist program, which allows designated agents to leverage the relationships and trust developed by our property management team with building owners and tenants.\nDE Title Services offers a full range of title insurance services to real estate buyers and financial institutions in New York and Florida.\nPortfolio Escrow, a leader in the California escrow market, delivers all relevant documents for recording to the appropriate county clerk's office, releases funds to the seller and any other agreed-upon entity.\nWe plan to expand our title and mortgage businesses into additional markets over the coming year.\nPage 13 shows that Douglas Elliman is currently considered the premier luxury brand in the U.S., with an established reputation for luxury and trust built over the last century.\nThis is a significant differentiator from our competitors.\nWe have successfully leveraged Elliman's brand equity to expand from our historical focus on the New York metropolitan area into new and adjacent luxury markets throughout Florida, California, Massachusetts, Colorado, and now Texas, where our clients often have primary, second, or third residences and where agents and clients recognize and trust the Douglas Elliman name.\nOur brand recognition and agent credibility lead to a large referral network among Elliman agents, who have numerous opportunities throughout the year to connect in person at exclusive events including Art Basel, the Winter Equestrian Festival, and the Hampton Classic.\nThese carefully curated events allow agents to develop personal and professional relationships and mutual trust with each other's clients looking to invest in multiple markets.\nTo build on this established brand presence, Douglas Elliman produces extensive owned content on social media for its digital magazine Elliman Insider and its quasi-print magazine Elliman.\nThe firm also generates earned media via important news organizations including The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, The Financial Times, and CNBC, building a high level of credibility in the real estate space and providing targeted exposure for brand initiatives, exclusive listings, new development projects, and closed deals.\nSuch important press coverage resonates with our clients as it showcases Elliman agents' and executives' thought leadership and contributes to a strong share of voice across all major markets in which we operate.\nAs shown in the chart, Elliman is number one in earned media in each of its principal markets including New York City, Florida, and Los Angeles.\nLastly, we sponsor the Miller Samuel report, the gold standard of market research in the residential brokerage world.\nJonathan Miller is the most quoted and respected researcher and analyst in our business, and our association with these reports builds a high credibility factor for our agents.\nPage 14 shows that Elliman has a large and growing presence in most of the leading luxury markets in the United States.\nOur 6,600 agents across the country are supported by our exclusive relationship with Knight Frank, which has an international network of approximately 500 offices and 19,000 agents.\nThis invaluable relationship is unique in the U.S. residential brokerage community and provides our agents with unprecedented global exposure to important buyers from around the world.\nThis is particularly significant today as our borders reopened to foreigners on November 9th.\nThe charts demonstrate our significant and growing market share in our principal markets, where we are consistently one of the largest firms in New York.\nOur focus on major U.S. luxury markets is reflected in Douglas Elliman having a substantially higher average transaction value than any of our major competitors, approximately $1.6 million year-to-date, significantly higher than Compass and Realogy.\nPage 15 begins to show that our general approach to real estate technology involves leveraging best-of-breed technology, proven technology around legacy investments, and new early-stage disruptive PropTech companies from New Valley Ventures.\nThis strategy gives our stakeholders access to rapidly changing industry-leading technology while enabling Douglas Elliman to benefit from traditional valuation growth of breakthrough PropTech companies.\nRecruiting tech experts to create new products within large corporations like Douglas Elliman is expensive, time-consuming, and rarely produces cutting-edge solutions, limiting the product's value to the company's own use.\nWe believe smaller, specialized PropTech companies are better suited for fostering technological innovation.\nOur open architecture technology infrastructure allows for easy integration of new features and functionalities, benefiting our agents and their clients.\nThis approach ensures our technology remains cutting-edge.\nWe maintain vendor flexibility and minimize costs.\nBy investing in early-stage PropTech companies, Douglas Elliman can gain exclusive access to innovative services while benefiting from these firms' growth and valuation without fully acquiring or building them.\nWe expect these investments to provide us with unique access to industry-leading technology, improving Douglas Elliman's business efficiency while capturing value created from the synergy between real estate and PropTech partnerships.\nOur agent portal, powered by invent.us, is built on a cloud-based SaaS infrastructure designed to quickly adapt and incorporate new initiatives and solutions.\nThe user-friendly portal features automated workflows, data-rich dashboards, and AI-backed reports for our agents.\nThe plug-and-play technology allows us to rapidly adjust our solutions in line with the PropTech industry's digital transformation.\nMoving to Page 16, this strategy enables us to quickly incorporate innovative technology to meet our business needs at a fast pace.\nFrom 2018 to 2020, we implemented 2 to 4 major solutions annually, in addition to minor changes to existing systems.\nIn 2021, we've rolled out nine solutions and aim to implement two more by year-end.\nThese include mobile CRM, DIY marketing tools, transaction management by rechat, AI integration by purlin, e-signing, online notary services, video capabilities, and expanded revenue opportunities through partnerships like Humming Homes for home services.\nOn Page 17, our open architecture technology strategy provides access to rapidly evolving industry-leading technology while allowing Douglas Elliman to benefit from potential revenue streams and valuation growth of breakthrough tech firms.\nElliman is introducing innovative PropTech solutions to Douglas Elliman Reality and the broader real estate community through its New Valley Ventures subsidiary.\nThis investment approach ensures Douglas Elliman and its agents remain at the industry's forefront with easily integrated new solutions, maintaining an asset-light model.\nThis includes access to fast-growing PropTech sectors like EV and green tech, which align well with our assets.\nThe PropTech companies we invest in gain access to Douglas Elliman's operations and distribution to grow their business, while simultaneously driving Elliman's growth and competitive edge.\nAn example of an additional revenue stream is our white-label homeowners engagement platform, supporting long-term client relationships by providing lifetime access to services like home management, moving assistance, HVAC support, and insurance.\nOur access to leading industry technology enhances agent productivity, earning potential, and satisfaction, supporting recruitment and retention of high-performing agents through attractive offerings and increased market share.\nI'll now hand it back to Scott for Pages 18 and 20.\nDouglas Elliman has a robust platform for continued expansion, including growth in existing markets, adjacent areas, and new territories.\nWe're focusing on organic growth through recruitment in major markets and expanding our presence in adjacent markets where the Elliman brand is well-known.\nIn New York, we're expanding into Westchester County, Greenwich, Connecticut, and New Jersey, while also growing our presence in Boston and nearby luxury summer markets.\nIn Florida, we're building on our strength in South Florida to increase our presence on the West Coast, with recent significant growth in Naples.\nWe've made a strategic decision to aggressively expand our business in Texas, restructuring our partnerships and actively recruiting top talent in Houston, Dallas, and Austin.\nWe believe Texas could become a major market for us, given its low tax rates and growing importance as a tech hub.\nOther potential markets for expansion include Nashville, Scottsdale, Denver, Las Vegas, and San Francisco, which also offer opportunities for new development sales and marketing.\nThese 18 markets represent approximately $180 billion in transaction value, potentially increasing our addressable market by 50%.\nOur new development sales and marketing platform is a crucial part of our business, with year-to-date revenues of $66.7 million and a strong pipeline.\nWe're actively working to expand this business into new markets, particularly in Texas.\nWe also see opportunities to expand ancillary services like mortgage, title, and escrow to enhance client experience and drive profitable revenue growth.\nAgent retention and recruitment are key to our continued growth, with a high retention rate of approximately 90% of our revenue.\nMost of our agents are long-tenured, with 87% of revenue coming from those who have been with us for over three years.\nOur company culture is often described as family-like, with many agents calling Elliman home for decades.\nForbes has consistently ranked us as one of the best places to work.\nWe foster entrepreneurialism and work closely with agents to develop unique business plans, leading to successful initiatives that bring Elliman worldwide recognition, such as Million Dollar Listing Los Angeles, Million Dollar Listing New York, and Kendra Sells Hollywood.\nDouglas Elliman boasts many of the most successful and visible agents in the U.S., and we pride ourselves on our track record of recruiting high-profile, top-tier agents attracted to our platform and brand strength.\nWe will continue investing in promising PropTech opportunities to drive growth, competitive differentiation, and benefit from adjacent revenue streams and potential valuation growth of breakthrough tech

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Michael Happe, the president and CEO, and Bryan Hughes, the senior VP and CFO, are accompanying me on the call today.\nI urge you to review our SEC filings, which outline these factors.\nWe greatly value your interest in Winnebago Industries and appreciate you joining us to discuss our Q4 and annual 2021 financial results.\nWe concluded fiscal 2021 with a robust Q4, marked by unprecedented revenue and profitability, driven by three key elements.\nSustained enthusiasm for outdoor activities continued to fuel demand for Winnebago Industries' premium offerings.\nWinnebago Industries' Q4 revenue increased by 40.4% compared to the previous year, and by 56.8% organically excluding Newmar, relative to Q4 of fiscal 2019.\nWinnebago Industries' market share growth accelerated in Q4, gaining 2.1 percentage points during the three months ending in August.\nThis growth is attributable to both new and experienced consumers who recognize the superior quality and innovation of Winnebago Industries' product range.\nWe are known for providing exceptional service in collaboration with our dealers.\nOur team's unwavering commitment to operational excellence allowed us to efficiently and profitably meet consumer and dealer needs during a challenging period of supply constraints and inflation.\nConsequently, we improved margins in both our motor home and towable divisions during Q4.\nI'd like to acknowledge the outstanding Winnebago Industries employee team.\nOur workforce, now over 6,800 strong with the addition of Barletta, has worked tirelessly to deliver the high-quality products and exceptional service our customers and dealers expect.\nWhile managing record-high backlogs to meet the tremendous product demand, their dedication has been crucial to our success this year.\nThe pandemic has undoubtedly accelerated the demand for outdoor experiences.\nWe believe this shift, which was already underway before COVID-19, will have a lasting impact as more families discover the great outdoors.\nIn 2020, over 10 million households went camping for the first time, and we expect another 4.3 million households to have their first camping experience in 2021.\nBesides newcomers, a new wave of enthusiasts, particularly millennials and younger generations, are investing more time and money in outdoor activities.\nEven as pandemic restrictions eased over the summer, potentially allowing for a wider range of vacation and leisure options, our performance during the summer selling season was strong.\nWe set revenue records in both our fiscal Q3 and Q4.\nOur record order backlog continues to grow, and we're seeing rapid sell-through of inventory provided to dealers.\nWe're confident that the diverse groups creating memories outdoors will form the foundation of our growth in the coming decades.\nWe're optimistic about the broader recreation economy and are investing to expand our reach beyond RVs, in line with our strategy to become a premier outdoor lifestyle company.\nWe completed our acquisition of Barletta Boat Company early in Q1 of our fiscal 2022.\nBuilding on our previous marine investment in the Chris-Craft brand, Barletta's premium pontoon boats significantly expand our marine platform into one of the fastest-growing boating segments.\nWe're excited to discuss the opportunities in our new marine reporting segment in future quarters.\nDue to the strength of our overall offering, we've successfully capitalized on the industry-wide demand for outdoor lifestyle products and delivered net total growth.\nWinnebago Industries is increasingly winning with customers, and we're proud that a disproportionate share of new outdoor enthusiasts have chosen to join the Winnebago Industries community.\nAs of August 2021, our RV fiscal year-to-date market share is 12.5%, up 140 basis points from the same period last year.\nWe've achieved these gains while maintaining record low levels of discounting.\nOur performance and ability to capture market share at full product value in a competitive market underscores the unique appeal of our diverse brand portfolio.\nContinued investment in our products and brands, unified by our commitment to quality, innovation, and service, ensures we're positioned to meet consumer demands for technology and capabilities, driving share gains now and in the future.\nOur world-class team expertly translated demand growth and market share gains into strong financial performance in Q4, demonstrating enterprise-wide commitment to operational efficiency despite ongoing pandemic challenges, including supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures.\nThese operational efforts are evident in our record consolidated annual gross margins of 17.9% for the fiscal year.\nA key element of our operational excellence is the success of our enterprise-wide operations and sourcing teams, who quickly adapted to component shortages and supply disruptions.\nOur team has remained flexible, using creative and strategic material sourcing strategies to keep our assembly lines moving.\nWe'll continue to monitor supply chain issues and provide updates with our results as long as they persist.\nOur efforts to improve communication across our supply chain have allowed us to better anticipate and plan for disruptions in partner component availability.\nWe're continuing to strengthen our relationships with our dedicated dealer network as we focus on replenishing their inventories as quickly as possible.\nWe're incredibly proud of our team's performance in Q4 and throughout fiscal 2021.\nOur results demonstrate that we're executing well on our proven value creation strategy.\nThe new heights we achieved in revenues and profitability showcase the unique strength and appeal of our growing platform, as well as our world-class team.\nI'll discuss Q4 and annual highlights, recent capital allocation announcements, and several items affecting future reporting.\nThis information is available on our investor relations website.\nAs Mike mentioned earlier, our fiscal Q4 was a strong conclusion to an outstanding fiscal 2021.\nQ4 revenues reached a record $1 billion, a 40% increase compared to Q4 of fiscal 2020.\nQ4 consolidated gross profit margin of 18.1% was up 150 basis points year-over-year due to leverage, pricing adjustments, lower discounts and allowances, and profitability initiatives.\nRecord Q4 revenues and strong margins resulted in record earnings per share.\nQ4 earnings per diluted share reached a record $2.45, a 96% increase versus the same period last year.\nQ4 adjusted earnings per diluted share hit a record $2.57, up 77% year-over-year.\nTurning to the full-year fiscal 2021 results, consolidated record revenues of $3.6 billion increased approximately 54% from $2.4 billion in fiscal 2020, driven by strong consumer demand for Winnebago Industries products and continued RV market share gains.\nRevenues were also positively impacted by pricing adjustments implemented throughout the year to offset inflationary input costs, as well as lower levels of discounts and allowances.\nThe yearly gross profit margin saw a significant improvement of 460 basis points, reaching a record 17.9%, mainly due to effective cost management, profitability measures, higher pricing with reduced discounts, and a favorable product mix.\nConsistent with the fourth quarter results, the strong annual revenue and healthy profit margins led to unprecedented levels of profitability.\nThe full-year earnings per diluted share reached a record $8.28, showing a 350% increase compared to the previous fiscal year.\nThe adjusted earnings per diluted share for the full year also hit a record $8.55, representing a 231% increase from $2.58 in the previous year.\nLet's now examine the performance of individual segments.\nThe Towable segment's fourth-quarter revenue was $560 million, showing a 35% increase from $414 million in the previous fiscal year, primarily due to high consumer demand and price adjustments made to counter rising input costs.\nThe segment's adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter rose by approximately 36% year-over-year to $83.4 million, mainly driven by higher revenue.\nThe fourth-quarter adjusted EBITDA margin increased by 10 basis points to 14.9% compared to the same period last year, primarily due to operational efficiencies, which was partially offset by a shift in product mix favoring travel trailers over fifth wheels.\nFor the entire fiscal year 2021, the Towable segment's revenue reached a record $2 billion, a 64% increase from fiscal 2020, driven by strong demand for towable products and price adjustments to offset rising input costs.\nThe segment's full-year adjusted EBITDA was $289 million, a 95% increase from fiscal 2020.\nThe segment's adjusted EBITDA margin for the full year improved by 230 basis points to 14.4% compared to fiscal 2020.\nNow, let's examine our Motorhome segment.\nIn the fourth quarter, the Motorhome segment's revenue was $448.9 million, approximately 49% higher than the previous year, driven by strong consumer demand, especially for Class B and Class A motorhomes, and price adjustments to counter inflation.\nThe segment's adjusted EBITDA increased by about 159% from the previous year to $50.4 million.\nThe adjusted EBITDA margin rose to 11.2%, an increase of 480 basis points year-over-year and 150 basis points sequentially, due to improved cost management and profitability initiatives.\nFor the full fiscal year 2021, the Motorhome segment's revenue was $1.5 billion, approximately 46% higher than fiscal 2020, due to increased unit sales and pricing.\nThe segment's full-year adjusted EBITDA was $169.2 million, a 414% increase from fiscal 2020.\nThe segment's adjusted EBITDA margin for the full year was 11%, an improvement of 790 basis points over fiscal 2020.\nLet's now look at the balance sheet.\nAt the end of fiscal year 2021, the company had outstanding debt of $528.6 million, consisting of $600 million in gross debt, minus a convertible note discount of $60.4 million and debt issuance costs of $11.1 million.\nThe working capital stood at $651.6 million.\nOur current net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio is 0.4, which is below our target range of 0.9 to 1.5, providing financial flexibility and a strong balance sheet to support ongoing investment in our strategic priorities and deliver returns to shareholders.\nWe continue to maintain a robust liquidity position.\nOur cash balance increased to $434.6 million at the end of fiscal 2021, and we have not drawn on our $192.5 million ABL.\nThis liquidity of approximately $627 million provided the necessary funding for the Barletta acquisition, which was completed at the start of fiscal 2022.\nWe also repurchased about $45 million worth of shares throughout the year, with approximately $35 million occurring in the fourth quarter.\nCombining share repurchases and dividends paid, Winnebago Industries returned a total of $62 million to shareholders in fiscal 2021, while also significantly growing the business.\nThe effective income tax rate for the full year was 23.3% compared to 20.5% for fiscal 2020, due to relatively consistent year-over-year tax credits on higher pre-tax income in fiscal 2021.\nLooking ahead to fiscal 2022, we anticipate our tax rate to be between 23.5% and 24.5%, barring any unforeseen discrete items or changes in tax law.\nOur balance sheet and financial health have never been stronger.\nWith this in mind and looking to the future, I'd like to discuss our capital allocation priorities.\nFirst, we will continue to invest in our business and advance our strategic priorities focused on growth and meeting the robust demand we continue to expect.\nWe are planning investments to increase capacity, including new facilities, implementing production flow redesigns, and optimizing our operational capabilities.\nThese improvements will support continued production output, as well as product innovation, and they demonstrate our confidence in Winnebago Industries' future and the vitality of our end markets.\nWe continuously seek areas for improvement across our Winnebago, Grand Design, Newmar, Chris-Craft, and now Barletta manufacturing and assembly facilities, and plan to add significant square footage in the coming year.\nOur acquisition of Barletta, completed at the beginning of fiscal 2022, was primarily funded with cash but also included newly issued shares.\nThis effective deal structure maintains our strong liquidity position and low leverage ratio, allowing us to continue pursuing M&A opportunities as they arise.\nIssuing shares also aligns all parties on driving a successful integration and our collective future success.\nOn August 18, 2021, our board of directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.18 per share, payable on September 29, 2021, to common stockholders of record at the close of business on September 15, 2021.\nThis quarter's dividend declaration represents a 50% or $0.06 per share increase from the previous quarter, further demonstrating our confidence in future business performance while also delivering financial returns to our shareholders.\nAs mentioned earlier, we returned approximately $45 million to shareholders through share repurchases during the year, with about $35 million occurring in the fourth quarter.\nTo enable further repurchase activity in the future, our board approved a new share buyback program on October 13, authorizing us to repurchase up to $200 million of our shares in the future.\nThis should be seen as a sign of our confidence in our future, and we will continue to use our share repurchase program as another way to return cash to our shareholders.\nBefore concluding my remarks, I want to highlight three changes to our reporting beginning with the first quarter of our fiscal year 2022.\nFirst, as previously announced, our acquisition of Barletta Boat Company significantly increases the scale of our marine platform.\nStarting next quarter, Q1 of fiscal 2022, Winnebago Industries' public reporting will include a new reporting segment, the Marine segment, comprising Barletta and Chris-Craft.\nComparisons will be made to fiscal 2021, which will only include Chris-Craft results, and we will report the same key data points for the Marine segment as we do with our RV segments, specifically revenues, units, adjusted EBITDA, backlog, and field inventories.\nSecond, going forward, we will be adjusting for 100% of intangible amortization within our adjusted earnings per diluted share metric.\nWe are taking this step to ensure that our adjusted earnings per share best reflects the core operations of our business.\nThird, the tax rate for adjusting items that impact reported earnings per share to arrive at adjusted earnings per share will be 24.2%.\nWe have historically used the federal statutory 21% rate.\nThis modification will be implemented moving forward, without restating previous years' data.\nIn summary, our fourth quarter and full year 2021 financial results demonstrate our strong market position and the valuable contributions of our diverse business portfolio and dedicated workforce.\nWe are immensely satisfied with these outcomes and have high hopes for our future performance.\nThis completes my overview of our quarterly and annual financial reports.\nLooking back on 2021, as Bryan mentioned, we're pleased with the financial, strategic, and cultural progress we've achieved together with our talented team.\nBesides delivering robust financial results and expanding our market share, Winnebago Industries also maintained our deep commitment to corporate responsibility towards our communities and shareholders.\nAs part of our dedication to the Winnebago Industries family and all stakeholders, we've made significant progress in enhancing our ESG initiatives across the organization.\nJill collaborates with company leadership to advance DEI programs and initiatives, guiding the implementation of our overall DEI strategy and roadmap.\nAs an illustration of supporting others, we established a year-round Go Together fund to assist employees facing natural disasters and personal hardships.\nFor instance, we recently mobilized resources to support earthquake relief efforts in Haiti, which is closely connected to many of our valued Chris-Craft team members.\nAt Winnebago Industries, we are devoted to promoting outdoor adventures while striving to be active protectors of the environment.\nIt is crucial to our mission that our employees and customers can enjoy the beautiful natural spaces our planet offers.\nTo reduce our environmental impact for future generations of outdoor enthusiasts, we recently reinforced our commitment to sustainability by joining the Business Ambition for 1.5 degrees Celsius, a UN-backed global coalition of business leaders.\nAs part of this program, we are pledging to help mitigate climate change by setting a goal to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.\nWe also announced additional targets for water conservation, waste reduction, and product sustainability.\nWe anticipate collaborating with the Science Based Targets initiative and external validators to develop a concrete plan for achieving this net-zero goal, which represents a key focus of our corporate responsibility strategy.\nAs we enter the upcoming year, you can expect us to continue prioritizing corporate responsibility in our investments and partnerships.\nLooking ahead to the future.\nThe unprecedented demand for our products and optimistic industry outlook have provided us with a very promising outlook for fiscal 2022.\nIn addition to leveraging the strength of our RV and Chris-Craft brands, we are thrilled to incorporate Barletta, the fastest-growing brand in the rapidly expanding pontoon segment of the marine category.\nBarletta's quality brand and high-caliber dealer partners enhance our existing portfolio of premium brands, providing more families access to the long-term value of Winnebago Industries' quality products.\nTogether, our brands exemplify quality, service, and innovation for our dealers and end consumers.\nThese are the key factors that will drive market share gains for us in the RV and marine industries during fiscal 2022 and beyond.\nConsumer interest in outdoor activities remains robust.\nCampground reservations, just one indicator, continue to be strong due to more households camping and camping more frequently.\nWebsite traffic on our sites is as high as ever, and dealers continue to observe steady interest in outdoor lifestyles involving RVs and boating.\nAs mentioned earlier, over 14 million households will have experienced camping for the first time during 2020 and 2021.\nMany of these experiences have resulted in families purchasing their first RV.\nAs these new households explore the outdoors and further define their preferences, our dealers are already witnessing the upgrade cycle taking place.\nWhile some new customers from 2020 are leaving the lifestyle, which is not historically unusual, our broad dealer conversations across all RV brands indicate dealers are also seeing an accelerated pace of users trading up, a trend that favors our premium brands as we tend to outperform the broader market when consumers upgrade.\nIn the long term, we believe the influx of new customers into the outdoor lifestyle in 2020 and 2021 will benefit the industry.\nWe're particularly excited about the number of children who experienced RV and boating, as these experiences have been shown to foster a lifelong love for the outdoors.\nRegarding supply, we continue to face material and component cost increases from suppliers, and we continue to manage out-of-stock situations or late deliveries on a weekly basis.\nThere is limited visibility as to when these trends will significantly diminish.\nDespite these challenges, we continue to deliver record-level revenues and margin growth as our teams work diligently to implement effective sourcing and production strategies.\nGiven the levels of cost input inflation we've experienced over the past year, we are carefully working to mitigate these cost increases through internal cost-saving initiatives.\nHowever, it has also been necessary for us to implement price increases to offset inflationary pressures while ensuring our products are perceived as having exceptional value in the marketplace.\nThe magnitude of price increases year-over-year across our brand portfolio varies from mid-single digits to over 20%.\nThere is no single price increase figure for our entire business.\nEach of our outdoor brands is blending a price-to-market and price-to-cost approach that protects profitable market share growth.\nConsequently, consumers are seeing higher prices for boats and RVs, as retail pricing is a combination of OEM pricing and improved dealer margins due to high demand levels.\nRetail pricing is not solely determined by OEM pricing strategy.\nDespite higher prices, we are still maintaining a higher double-digit percentage retail pace currently compared to two years ago.\nBefore we open the call for questions, I want to briefly address expectations for the RV industry in the upcoming year.\nWe agree with the recently released RVIA forecast for calendar year 2022, which predicts 600,000 wholesale shipments, representing a 4% growth compared to the calendar year 2021 forecast of 577,000 units.\nFor Winnebago Industries' fiscal year 2022, the RVIA forecast translates to 605,000 wholesale industry shipments, or 6% growth compared to the fiscal 2021 figure of 569,000 units.\nRV retail sales for the industry in our fiscal year 2021 were approximately 585,000 units, a record number that will likely be adjusted upwards as SSI adjustments occur in the coming months.\nLooking ahead, we anticipate strong RV industry retail sales for fiscal 2022.\nAlthough they may not reach the record fiscal 2021 retail results, we fully expect industry retail sales for our fiscal 2022 period to achieve the second-highest level on record.\nGiven this outlook, it is highly unlikely that industry field RV inventories will be adequately replenished by the end of our fiscal year 2022, suggesting that the restocking phase will continue into our fiscal 2023.\nAs we approach inventory normalization in the future, we've previously mentioned that some dealers, though not all, may work with lower inventory levels and higher turns.\nIn line with historical trends as markets normalize, dealers will rationalize the quantity of OEM brands on their lots, and we believe we are competitively advantaged in that scenario with our brands.\nWe also anticipate that dealers will return to more normal or historical levels of profitability, implying that pricing to end customers may ease as this occurs and as general inflation subsides in the future.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Brian Casey, our President and CEO, and Terry Forbes, our CFO, are joining us on today's call.\nWe trust you're staying safe during these challenging times for everyone.\nI'll review our quarterly results and discuss how the COVID-19 crisis is affecting our company, as usual.\nThe previous quarter was truly unprecedented.\nThe worldwide COVID-19 outbreak spread rapidly, causing a sharp decline in liquidity and returns, with March being particularly devastating.\nThe S&P 500 experienced its worst first-quarter performance since 1928, and global equity and fixed income markets were similarly impacted.\nInvestors are closely monitoring the potential peak in new virus cases for indications about the future, although the path to economic recovery remains uncertain.\nIn our U.S. Value Equity offerings, the unprecedented equity sell-off was significant in absolute terms, but higher-quality companies across all market capitalizations performed relatively better.\nAll of our U.S. Value strategies outperformed their respective passive benchmarks, demonstrating the clear advantages of active management.\nOur primary LargeCap Value strategy demonstrated resilience during the market downturn, experiencing only about 85% of the decline and outperforming the Russell 1000 Value Index by nearly 400 basis points.\nLargeCap Value is outpacing the benchmark over various time frames, and its ranking among institutional LargeCap Value peers remains strong.\nAs of the first quarter, our LargeCap Value strategy ranked in the top 10% for the trailing three-year period and in the top 25% for the trailing one-, five- and seven-year periods.\nOur LargeCap Select strategy also ended the quarter ahead of the Russell 1000 Value benchmark and now ranks in the top 10% among institutional peers in the eVestment large-cap value manager universe for the trailing three-year period.\nOur SMidCap strategy outperformed the Russell 2500 Value Index by over 400 basis points and now has returns surpassing the benchmark in most trailing year periods.\nRankings among institutional peers were also impressive.\nThe strategy now ranks in the top half for the trailing five and seven years and in the top 25% for the trailing one- and three-year periods.\nOur portfolio managers have diligently worked to enhance the track record, and we're observing increased interest in the strategy from institutional clients.\nSmallCap was the most severely impacted sector of our U.S. Value strategies, but our portfolio managers maintained their focus on identifying companies with strong fundamental qualities and finished the quarter approximately 260 basis points ahead of the Russell 2000 Value benchmark.\nOur institutional strategy also maintained favorable peer rankings, placing in the top third for the quarter and trailing one-year period.\nSmallCap's longer-term performance places it in the top 10% over the trailing seven-, 10- and since inception periods.\nAs we navigate the economic situation created by COVID-19, market volatility will present attractive investment opportunities for high-conviction, actively managed portfolios centered on quality and value.\nWhile the value style, which focuses on companies with low valuation levels, has historically performed best following a recession, many companies today have higher debt levels than in previous cycles and may find themselves with limited options.\nFinancial distress is particularly severe in the energy sector, and we're already witnessing several companies filing for bankruptcy protection.\nAs the market pays more attention to balance sheets, the strongest companies will thrive while those burdened with debt from the previous cycle will struggle.\nOur investment process has always included a thorough analysis of a candidate's balance sheet, which has historically benefited our clients during times of stress.\nMany index funds have over one-third of their portfolios invested in companies with no profits and high debt levels.\nMounting losses and debt will be detrimental to many of these companies, and we believe this is an opportune time for investors to move away from index funds and towards active managers who can skillfully navigate the landscape of winners and losers.\nShifting focus to our Multi-Asset group, our product range in Multi-Asset includes various strategies aligned across the risk and return spectrum, tailored to meet specific client risk profiles and investment objectives.\nIncome Opportunity, our largest strategy in the group, displayed attractive characteristics compared to equity markets.\nHowever, investors' rush to perceived safe assets drove treasury returns up and hindered our relative performance.\nAsset classes such as preferred stocks, convertible bonds, and mortgage-backed securities experienced significant declines during the quarter.\nThe drop in convertible securities has created opportunities not seen since the global financial crisis.\nThis has created a favorable environment for investors to consider strategies like our Global Convertible and Alternative Income strategies, which have historically delivered strong risk-adjusted results.\nOur Global Convertible and Alternative Income strategies performed as expected and acted as diversifiers in asset allocation mixes during a highly challenging and volatile period.\nCorrelations across capital markets converged to one, and volatility reached levels last observed during the global financial crisis.\nCompared to similar institutions, our Alternative Income approach ranked in the top fifth for the past year and top tenth for the past five, seven, and ten years.\nFor Emerging Markets, valuations remain attractive, especially when compared to developed markets after the asset class's recent underperformance.\nOur strategies underperformed mainly because we had less exposure to China and Hong Kong than the benchmark.\nEmerging Markets worldwide experienced unprecedented volatility, with reactions to COVID-19 being quick and widespread.\nInvestors sought any available liquidity, and these markets were particularly affected by this rush to cash and safety.\nThis reaction also led to significant currency devaluations in several emerging market countries we invest in, including Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, and Chile.\nWe anticipate that this volatility will continue.\nThe extent and duration of the economic impacts are yet to be determined and will differ across regions.\nMany large emerging markets outside China are currently under lockdown, and governments are still formulating their economic responses.\nAs with our other strategies, market disruptions have created opportunities to invest in companies with strong leadership, cash flow, and financial stability.\nOur focus on high-quality companies has helped us navigate past crises and gives us confidence that our holdings will be well-positioned for the long term.\nIn Wealth Management, our Dallas and Houston teams have been proactively reaching out to clients to help them navigate market uncertainty.\nMany of our wealthy clients are choosing to increase their investments during this time to capitalize on the market downturn and prepare for an eventual recovery.\nWe have expanded Westwood Private Bank's services for our high-net-worth clients, improving our ability to keep clients within the Westwood brand ecosystem.\nThe combination of banking services integrated with Westwood's existing financial planning, trust, and investment services is being well-received by our clients.\nLooking ahead, Westwood Trust will begin introducing our new digital portal to enhance client engagement.\nThe Select Equity strategy, managed by the Westwood Trust Houston office, saw its risk management measures perform as expected this quarter, outperforming its benchmark.\nSelect Equity and its tax-efficient version are designed to provide a high-quality, low-turnover portfolio with risk controls for downside protection.\nAt the market's lowest points this quarter, both strategies held up well due to their emphasis on risk control and investments in companies with strong balance sheets.\nBoth versions of our strategy recently reached their three-year milestone and are outperforming their global benchmark.\nFurthermore, we conduct tax-loss harvesting throughout the year instead of waiting until year-end, which helps reduce our clients' tax liabilities and has provided over 200 basis points of additional annualized alpha over the past three years.\nIn our institutional and intermediary sales group, we had inflows of nearly $400 million and $950 million in outflows, resulting in total net outflows of $560 million.\nThe majority of outflows were from our sub-advisor relationships in LargeCap Value, Global Converts, Alternative Income, and Emerging Markets.\nSmallCap was again our most successful strategy, with net inflows for the quarter as existing clients added funds to their accounts and new clients invested in our mutual fund.\nGiven the strong relative performance of our U.S. strategies, we believe we're well-positioned to attract sales in the current environment.\nOur investments in distribution infrastructure and alignment of investment teams, vehicles, pricing, product definitions, risk guidelines, and messaging have allowed us to create a unified message that positions our sales teams for success.\nOur intermediary and institutional investment teams continue to work on gaining consultant approvals, and overall, our pipeline remains healthy and diverse across several strategies.\nNew opportunities were added in SmallCap and Income Opportunity during the quarter, and a significant portion of our pipeline is in the mid- to late-stage, with decisions expected throughout the year.\nWe have made significant progress in obtaining approvals for our SmallCap fund at several major wirehouses.\nAlthough COVID-19 has disrupted markets and slowed the sales cycle with prospects, our distribution teams continue to execute our plan to build a broader, more sustainable distribution business, and our client services teams continue to provide excellent service to our clients.\nWhile face-to-face meetings are not possible, our teams are functioning relatively normally.\nWe recently conducted an online campaign targeting 25,000 advisors and were pleased to see over 10,000 views.\nConference calls, portfolio updates, RFPs, and questionnaires are proceeding as usual.\nWe understand that clients and consultants require timely and relevant communication.\nThey need information on how the pandemic is affecting portfolios and our investment decisions, and they want to know how our business continuity plan is functioning and adapting.\nOur remote work success is a crucial area of investigation for clients seeking to understand how we've maintained our business integrity in the current environment.\nThe asset management sector was already facing challenges such as reduced fees, shrinking margins, and rising costs for data and technology before the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn the past, I've mentioned that Westwood has made significant technological investments to cut costs, improve operational efficiency, prepare for disruptions, and enhance our flexibility.\nThese investments have proven valuable, allowing us to increase efficiency and transition to a fully operational remote work environment with minimal disruption.\nWe will persist in evaluating our business and implementing significant measures to reduce our expenses.\nWe have identified and are implementing or processing over $750,000 in cost reductions throughout the remainder of the year.\nFor the past six months, we've been investigating the outsourcing of trading and have recently decided to proceed with this initiative.\nWe plan to transition to an outsourced trading model in late summer and anticipate annual savings of over $1 million starting in 2021.\nWe will continue to use technology to shape our future state and improve efficiency wherever possible.\nWe will shut down or eliminate unprofitable funds and focus on deploying our best products and personnel.\nDespite disappointing financial results over the past year, we continue to implement numerous initiatives to strengthen our foundation for the future.\nOur collaboration with InvestCloud continues to yield operational advantages.\nThe U.S. Value and Multi-Asset strategies are generating alpha, and we have secured commitments from private wealth clients for a new credit opportunities fund launched recently.\nWe anticipate ongoing industry disruption, and the steps we've taken to reinvent ourselves have positioned us to survive and grow.\nI want to stress that our top priority is the health and safety of our employees and their families.\nAll our staff members are healthy, working remotely, and completing their tasks efficiently.\nWe recognize our responsibility to run the business while balancing company needs with employees' personal requirements.\nI'm extremely proud of everyone at Westwood for their excellent

total revenues of $16.7 million for Q1 2020, compared to $18.6 million in Q4 2019 and $23.9 million in Q1 2019.\nThe decrease from the previous quarter and the same quarter last year was mainly due to lower average assets under management.\nQ1 net income was $1.1 million or $0.13 per share, compared to $2.5 million or $0.30 per share in Q4 2019.\nThe decrease was primarily attributed to lower total revenues and unrealized losses on private investments, partially offset by reduced operating expenses and income taxes.\nEconomic earnings, a non-GAAP measure, were $4.2 million or $0.50 per share in Q1 2020, versus $5.4 million or $0.64 per share in Q4 2019.\nQ1 2020 net income of $1.1 million or $0.13 per share compared to $0.4 million or $0.05 per share in Q1 2019.\nThe increase was mainly due to lower operating expenses, particularly employee compensation and benefits, foreign currency transaction gains, and income taxes, partially offset by lower revenues and unrealized losses on private investments.\nEconomic earnings for Q1 2020 were $4.2 million or $0.50 per share, compared to $4.1 million or $0.49 per share in Q1 2019.\nAt the end of the quarter, firmwide assets under management totaled $11.6 billion, consisting of $6.3 billion (55%) in institutional assets, $3.8 billion (33%) in wealth management assets, and $1.5 billion (12%) in mutual fund assets.\nDuring the quarter, we

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Joining me as co-host are our Executive Chairman, Bill Berkeley, and our Group CFO, Rich Baio.\nWe'll stick to our usual format, with Rich providing an overview of the quarter and highlighting key points shortly.\nAfter that, I'll share some brief comments before we open the floor for questions.\nRich, please take it from here.\nOur business continues to show strong growth, as evidenced by increased premiums and improved underwriting profits, reflecting higher rates and additional premiums from increased exposure in our financial statements.\nWe achieved a new record in underwriting profit for the second consecutive quarter in Q2 2021, along with robust net investment income, resulting in a 15% annualized return on equity at the beginning of the year.\nThe company reported $237 million in net income, equivalent to $1.27 per share.\nThis includes $219 million in operating income ($1.17 per share) and $18 million in after-tax net investment gains ($0.10 per share).\nExamining our quarterly underwriting performance, gross premiums written increased by $529 million (24.8%) to nearly $2.7 billion.\nNet premiums written grew by $472 million (27.2%) to over $2.2 billion, with increases in both segments.\nOur overall cession rate decreased this quarter due to changes in outward reinsurance arrangements, reduced reinstatement premiums, and shifts in business mix.\nIn terms of segment production for net premiums written, the insurance segment grew 29.2% to almost $2 billion, with increases across all business lines.\nProfessional liability led the growth at 64.8%, followed by commercial auto at 31%, other liability at 28.7%, short tail lines at 21.2%, and workers' compensation at 15.6%.\nThe reinsurance and Monoline Excess segment increased by about 11% to $218 million, with Monoline Excess growing 20.9% and casualty reinsurance 17.5%, partially offset by a 13.8% decrease in property reinsurance.\nUnderwriting income improved due to compounding rate increases above loss cost trends, exposure growth, and lower claims frequency in certain business lines.\nWe experienced higher-than-average non-weather related property losses this quarter, which partially offset these benefits.\nAdditionally, our current accident year catastrophe losses decreased significantly from $146 million (8.7 loss ratio points) in the previous year to $44 million (2.2 loss ratio points) in the current quarter.\nConsequently, quarterly underwriting income rose by almost 800% to a record $202 million.\nThe reported loss ratio for the current quarter was 61%, compared to 67.7% in 2020.\nPrior-year loss reserves developed favorably by approximately $0.5 million in the current quarter.\nAs a result, our current accident year loss ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 58.8% compared to 59.2% for the same quarter last year.\nThe continued growth in net premiums earned has improved the expense ratio, which was 28.7% in the current quarter compared to 31% a year ago.\nNet premiums earned surpassed underwriting expenses by more than 8.5%.\nWe continue to benefit from reduced travel and entertainment costs, but anticipate some of these savings will diminish as the economy fully reopens.\nTo summarize the underwriting performance, our current accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 87.5% for the quarter, compared to 90.2% for the same period last year.\nRegarding investments, net investment income increased by 96.9% to $168 million, driven by strong performance in investment funds.\nThe fixed maturity portfolio showed a decline quarter-over-quarter due to the lower interest rate environment, although the quarterly gap is narrowing.\nWe maintain an above-average level of cash and cash equivalents as of June 30, 2021, which has been decreasing over recent quarters as we identify opportunities to invest at attractive risk-adjusted returns.\nOur duration remains steady at 2.4 years while maintaining a high credit quality of AA minus.\nThe quarter's pre-tax net investment gains of $24 million mainly consisted of $39 million in realized investment gains, an $18 million decrease in unrealized equity securities gains, and a $3 million reduction in expected credit loss allowance.\nThe sale of two real estate properties largely contributed to the realized gain, also resulting in a reduction of approximately $102 million in debt associated with one of the properties.\nCorporate costs rose by about $13 million, attributed to $8 million in debt extinguishment expenses related to hybrid securities redemption on June 1st, along with increased incentive compensation costs.\nWe established a new operating unit in the second quarter, with its expenses currently reflected in corporate until it begins operations and is subsequently moved to underwriting expenses.\nStockholders' equity grew by $164 million to roughly $6.6 billion in the quarter, following regular and special dividends totaling $112 million.\nBook value per share grew 2.5% in the quarter, while book value per share before dividends increased 4.3%.\nOperating cash flow remained robust, with approximately $700 million year-to-date.\nI'll now hand it back to Rob.\nLet me share a few brief observations before we move on to your Q&A, where we can discuss any topics you'd like.\nBy almost any standard, the company had an excellent quarter.\nFrom my viewpoint, this success has been building for some time.\nFurthermore, there's mounting evidence suggesting more positive developments are on the horizon, which is quite encouraging.\nDelving deeper into the market, we're seeing rate increases that surpass our loss trend estimates across major product lines, except for workers' compensation, even as we factor in higher financial inflation.\nFor workers' compensation, there are early indications that the rate of decline is slowing, although we're closely monitoring wage inflation and its potential impact on the comp economic model.\nRich outlined the top line growth of over 27%, which is substantial.\nIt's worth noting that in Q2 2020, our top line didn't drastically decrease; we were roughly flat.\nSo this growth isn't simply a return to normal levels, but a significant increase.\nAs Richard mentioned regarding the Excess and reinsurance segment, we chose not to participate in a few domestic treaty deals where we felt the rates weren't sufficiently attractive.\nBreaking down the 27% overall growth, about a third comes from rate increases, with the remainder from exposure growth, given the rate increase excluding comp was just under 10%.\nIt's crucial not to over-interpret the rate increase or compare it too closely with previous quarters or years.\nOur economic model is multifaceted; we consider available margins in the business.\nAs margins become more attractive, we may shift focus from pushing for higher rates to prioritizing exposure growth.\nWhile we're still pursuing and achieving rate increases that generally outpace trends (excluding comp), we're also capitalizing on opportunities for exposure growth as margins in much of our portfolio become increasingly appealing.\nRegarding the top line, it's worth noting that our specialty businesses, particularly our E&S operations, are experiencing a flood of submissions.\nThe economy is opening up, which is benefiting us across the board, and the market continues to reassess its appetite.\nThe reopening economy is having a positive impact on workers' compensation.\nWe've previously expressed concerns about that product line and its rate trends.\nHowever, our release shows growth in that product line, driven primarily by increased payroll.\nThis growth reflects the ongoing recovery and health of the US economy.\nShifting focus to the combined ratio, I'd like to add a few observations from my perspective.\nThe expense ratio of 28.7% is satisfactory, with room for improvement.\nAs travel and entertainment activities increase, we may see changes in expenses.\nThe COVID-related expense benefit of about 50 basis points is likely to diminish and eventually disappear.\nHowever, the increasing earned premium should provide more benefits over time, as written premium typically precedes earned premium.\nThe loss ratio is favorable at 61%, with the ex-cat accident year at 58.8%.\nNon-cat property loss activity added just over two points compared to last year's figures.\nWe experienced a series of fires, which some might attribute to bad luck, but we're investigating to ensure it's not a new trend.\nThe paid loss ratio was an attractive 44.3.\nRegarding our investment portfolio, the duration is 2.4 years, with a book yield also at approximately 2.4.\nWe remain highly focused on inflation, which we believe is already present.\nSome suggest inflation is transient, but regardless of duration, costs are currently higher.\nEven if inflation settles at 2.5% to 3%, we believe a 10-year yield at 1.30% or lower is unsustainable in the long term.\nWe've made significant efforts to restructure aspects of our balance sheet and capital structure, including calling certain securities.\nThe earnings potential of the business, particularly in 2022 and 2023, will benefit significantly from savings in capital costs.\nIn summary, it was a very good quarter, and the outlook for the coming quarters and years is even more encouraging.\nOur organization is well-positioned to benefit from broader macroeconomic conditions.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Certain risks are mentioned in our SEC filings.\nJoining me on today's call are Paul McDermott, Steve Riffee, Taryn Fielder, Drew Hammond, and Grant Montgomery, who hold various executive positions in our company.\nI wish you and your loved ones good health and safety.\nYesterday evening, we published our fourth quarter financial results, concluding a year focused on stabilizing our core operations and safeguarding future growth opportunities amid one of the most challenging business environments in recent memory.\nAs vaccine distribution began towards the end of last year, we are observing increased activity in both our multifamily and commercial portfolios.\nFor our urban multifamily properties, net applications increased by 30% year-over-year in January, and year-to-date trends already show improved occupancy as we approach the spring leasing season.\nOur aim is to increase occupancy to begin reducing concessions and raising rents.\nMultifamily occupancy currently exceeds 95%, not including our two rent-controlled properties where we are not prioritizing occupancy gains due to limited rent growth potential in the current market conditions.\nCredit performance in our multifamily sector remains exceptionally strong at both urban and suburban properties, consistently outperforming the national average by a significant margin over the past year.\nAlthough multifamily lease rates decreased by 3.6% and 5.7% on a gross and effective blended basis during the fourth quarter, we believe December represented the peak of rental rate pressure, as lease rate changes improved in January month-over-month and concessions decreased.\nMoreover, new and renewal lease agreements with February and March start dates indicate continued improvement and effective lease rate growth.\nOur renewal rates were robust during the fourth quarter and have maintained that strength into 2021.\nUrban and suburban renewal lease rate growth both increased by 90 basis points during the fourth quarter to 1.7% and 3.1% respectively, with these renewal rate increases remaining stable through January.\nThe ongoing pricing power we're experiencing at our suburban properties, combined with the ability to influence lease terms through concessions, has allowed us to shift more leases to future spring and summer expirations at our newest multifamily assets.\nDue to strategic management of our lease expiration schedule, only 20% of our leases expired during the fourth quarter and only 17% expire in the first quarter.\nWe believe December marked the lowest point for pricing, given the improving year-to-date trends we're observing.\nWe anticipate that the vaccine-led recovery will lead to a turning point in 2021 heading into 2022.\nHowever, it's too early to determine the exact timing and extent of this benefit in 2021.\nAbout two-thirds of our multifamily leases expire during the stronger spring and summer months, and we expect these leases will benefit from an increased number of vaccinations.\nIn the meantime, we plan to continue focusing on increasing occupancy and maximizing our retention rates, which continue to surpass our regional average.\nRegarding our commercial properties, credit performance continues to hold up very well, as Steve will discuss in more detail.\nWe anticipate that the majority of our commercial credit losses are behind us.\nOur projections suggest that commercial occupancy could increase by nearly 4% by year-end, although there is still too much uncertainty to accurately predict occupancy gains throughout the year.\nNevertheless, our outlook is improving, and we're seeing indications that tenant decision-making is accelerating.\nLeasing activity increased significantly in January, and active long-term renewal discussions with major tenants are progressing well.\nFor instance, in January, we received a signed letter of intent from Sunrise Senior Living to renew their space at Silverline, which currently represents about 1.5% of office revenue.\nWe also have signed letters of intent with B. Riley and an accredited third party at Arlington Tower.\nB. Riley has a termination option in December 2022 and will exercise this option on only one of its three floors, allowing the third party to enter into a sublease for this entire floor through 2022 and then sign a direct lease with us through 2029.\nB. Riley will extend the lease for the remainder of their space through 2026.\nAdditionally, in January, we signed a 45,000 square foot, five-year lease renewal with Giant Food at Takoma Park, which is our second-largest retail tenant and accounts for over 6% of other rental income.\nWe also signed a 15,000 square foot, 10-year lease renewal with our grocery anchor at Montrose Shopping Center.\nThese two lease renewals represent approximately 10% of our retail rental income.\nAs we enter the recovery phase, our office portfolio offers substantial growth potential, given that much of the available space is high-quality, move-in ready, and located in our best assets.\nWe have a weighted average lease term of about five years, limited near-term lease expirations, and our price points and floor layouts are well-suited for our market.\nThe average tenant size in our market and the space requirement that sees the most demand is about 4,000 to 6,000 square feet, which aligns with both our median tenant size and the tenant size with the highest demand in the current environment.\nWe have no exposure to co-working operators, no co-working tenants, and no single-tenant risk.\nWe continue to see good traction with Space Plus, our proprietary flexible office program that is managed in-house with spaces strategically located throughout our portfolio.\nSpace Plus represents approximately 3% of our office portfolio and is well-positioned for when decision-making picks up.\nSpace Plus offers move-in ready, private spaces that allow tenants to control the health and safety of their environment and provides more flexibility than traditional leases.\nFurthermore, Space Plus offers premium pricing compared to traditional leases and, on average, has much longer terms than co-working providers achieve, allowing us to capitalize on the increasing demand for flexible office space while maintaining our weighted average lease term and opportunities for future portfolio transformation.\nWhile uncertainty about the timing and pace of reopening persists, the resilience of our region provides relative stability compared to other major metropolitan areas.\nSince the start of the pandemic, the Washington Metro area has experienced fewer job losses than other major metropolitan areas and has already regained roughly 180,000 jobs, or 56% of the jobs lost from February to May.\nMoreover, these job losses have been largely confined to non-office-using sectors, as office-using sector employment in the Washington Metro market declined only 2% year-over-year in 2020, according to BLS data.\nAs we progress towards a vaccine-driven recovery, our region has several unique catalysts to accelerate the rebound in demand.\nThe growing, high-tech labor pool, federal investments in cloud, cyber, and artificial intelligence, as well as affordable office rents, continue to drive information sector leasing activity in Northern Virginia.\nAmazon continues to expand its regional office footprint and remains on schedule with HQ2 hiring.\nThroughout 2020, the tech sector contributed 36% of total leasing volume and more than 800,000 square feet of occupancy growth in Northern Virginia, according to CBRE.\nTech-driven leasing demand led to positive absorption for the sector in the fourth quarter, and that momentum has continued into January with Microsoft's announcement of a new 180,000 square foot sales headquarters in Rosslyn, adjacent to Arlington Tower and strategically located at the intersection of four bridges, five major road networks, and three metro lines, offering easy access to the Pentagon and Downtown DC.\nGovernment contract awards are expected to remain at record highs in 2021, and the cloud market alone is forecast to grow 9% to 10% annually over the next three years, according to JLL.\nNorthern Virginia's diversification over the past decade, blending government contracting with direct federal leasing, technology sector growth, investments in higher education, and medicine, has positioned it for a quicker-than-average office market recovery in 2021 and beyond, according to Newmark.\nWith the arrival of our newly aligned administration, the Washington Metro market is poised to benefit from a surge in activity.\nHistorically, alignment between the executive and legislative branches has resulted in a higher number of legislative bills passed, with increased lobbying and legal presence in DC to influence, write, and then implement legislation, leading to higher absorption in the DC office market.\nThe historical correlation between office absorption and years with aligned branches of government is very strong.\nAdditionally, the election should have a positive effect on our local partner market and may even accelerate a shift back into the city for renters.\nData analyzed by CBRE over the past six Presidential elections indicates that, on average, DC Metro rent growth was more than double the US average during the six months following each election.\nFurthermore, market-level data suggests that urban submarkets, which have underperformed suburban areas during this downturn, will likely benefit the most from the boost in activity associated with the Presidential election.\nIt's worth noting that these catalysts are historically unique to the Washington Metro area compared to other gateway metropolitan markets.\nThis past year has been eventful and unexpected, and alongside the challenges we have successfully navigated, we continue to make progress on derisking and improving our portfolio.\nThe COVID-19 crisis has reinforced our dedication to and focus on our capital allocation strategy as we transform WashREIT.\nAfter our Q4 office property sales and including stable income from Trove, multifamily now makes up 53% of our NOI, while office and retail account for 41% and 6% respectively.\nI'll begin by examining the balance sheet before discussing our Q4 and full-year financial results and future prospects.\nAmid the market uncertainty of 2020, we took measures to bolster our balance sheet and enhance operational flexibility, positioning us better for the pandemic recovery phase.\nWe ensured ample liquidity at the pandemic's start by securing a $150 million one-year term loan with extension options.\nWe issued a $350 million 10-year Green Bond at 3.44% in December, using the proceeds to repay the new $150 million term loan and another $150 million term loan due in March 2021.\nThese actions addressed all our debt maturities through Q4 2022 and extended our maturity schedule.\nWe fully unencumbered the balance sheet, allowing maximum flexibility as we continue investing in multifamily growth.\nWe increased our financial flexibility for 2021 through strategic office asset sales and issuing equity via the ATM program, preparing us for future capital allocation when recovery becomes more certain.\nAt year-end, we had only $42 million outstanding on our fully available $700 million credit line, demonstrating our increased liquidity during the pandemic.\nAll our covenant ratios remained strong, and we maintained our investment-grade ratings with Moody's (Baa2) and S&P (BBB flat).\nRegarding cash collection performance, our multifamily collections continue to excel, surpassing national averages.\nWe collected 99% of cash and contractual rents in Q4, with January collections following this trend.\nWe've offered payment deferral programs to pandemic-affected residents, with only about $15,000 in deferred multifamily rent remaining.\nOur office and retail collections improved sequentially in Q4, continuing the trend of steady improvement since the pandemic's onset.\nWe collected 99% of cash rents and over 99% of contractual rents from office tenants in Q4.\nDeferred rent for office tenants totaled $1 million as of January 31, with expectations to collect about 75% by year-end.\nWe collected 94% of retail cash rents in Q4, or approximately 97% excluding deferred rent.\nNet deferred rent for retail tenants was $1 million as of January 31, 2021, with expectations to collect 40% by year-end.\nOverall, we've deferred a small portion of rent, with the expected cumulative cash NOI impact less than $0.01 per share through year-end 2021.\nRegarding financial performance, we reported a net loss of $15.7 million or $0.20 per diluted share for 2020, compared to net income of $383.6 million or $4.75 per diluted share in 2019.\nThe decrease primarily stems from net gains on asset sales in 2019 versus small losses on sales in 2020.\nCore FFO of $1.45 per diluted share for 2020 aligned with our guidance range midpoint.\nYear-over-year, core FFO per share declined by $0.26 due to 2019 strategic transactions and pandemic impacts on leasing, parking income, and credit losses.\nOverall same-store NOI declined 5.4% year-over-year on a GAAP basis and 4.9% on a cash basis for 2020.\nMultifamily same-store NOI fell 0.9% and 1% on GAAP and cash bases for the year, and 7.2% and 7.3% for Q4.\nThe declines were primarily driven by new lease rate decreases at our urban assets, which comprised our entire same-store portfolio in 2020.\nWe maintained occupancy at 94.3% in Q4, excluding Trove.\nOffice same-store NOI declined 7.1% and 6.4% on GAAP and cash bases for the year, and 12.7% for Q4.\nThese declines resulted from lower parking income, move-outs, increased credit losses, and lease intangibles write-offs related to COVID-19.\nRetail same-store NOI decreased by $2.1 million and $1.8 million on GAAP and cash bases for the year, and $0.7 million for Q4.\nThese declines were primarily due to COVID-19 related credit losses and lease intangibles write-offs.\nCommercial credit losses reduced our core FFO by about $0.02 per share this quarter, higher than Q3 but in line with Q2.\nThe sequential increase was mainly due to lease intangibles write-offs, not indicative of overall portfolio credit performance.\nWe believe we've addressed apparent credit risks and expect steady improvement in credit performance over the coming year.\nIn Q4, we signed about 9,000 square feet of new office leases and 22,000 square feet of office renewals.\nOffice rental rates declined for new leases but increased for renewals.\nLease renewal negotiations increased substantially in December, continuing into January.\nWe signed about 8,000 square feet of new retail leases and 3,000 square feet of renewals in Q4, achieving rental rate increases.\nSince year-end, we've signed about 60,000 square feet of retail leases, representing 10% of our retail portfolio revenues.\nLooking ahead, growth prospects have improved with vaccine rollouts, but the timing of the inflection point remains uncertain.\nWe expect rapid improvement once we reach that point, carrying over into 2022.\nWhile we believe the most disruptive part of the pandemic is behind us, the timing and pace of economic reopening remain uncertain.\nWe can provide FFO guidance for Q1 but lack sufficient visibility for full-year FFO guidance.\nWe are providing full-year guidance ranges for financial performance metrics we can forecast with reasonable accuracy.\nThough we can't predict the full pandemic impact before the anticipated inflection point, we'll discuss portfolio areas expected to be most responsive and offer the most upside growth potential once the economy recovers.\nAt the end of the year, the total occupancy rate for the operating portfolio of multifamily properties reached 94.3%, which aligns with expectations and shows a relatively consistent trend since the second quarter's conclusion.\nAs a positive development, occupancy has increased since the year's end, and leading indicators suggest a steady improvement in occupancy as we approach the peak leasing season.\nOccupancy has risen to slightly above 95%, not including our two rent-controlled properties, and we're observing effective lease rates moving in a favorable direction.\nFurthermore, there has been a significant year-over-year increase in net application volumes for urban properties.\nWe previously anticipated substantial multifamily growth in 2020, but this growth is now likely to be postponed until the economic recovery, driven by widespread vaccination, takes hold.\nAlthough we anticipate a seasonal uptick in the second quarter, we expect broader inflections to occur at some point in 2021, extending into 2022.\nIt's crucial to have a more significant impact on 2022.\nWe have a five-year plan for value-add renovations ready to resume when conditions improve.\nWe continue to expect future NOI growth in the Trove, which I'll discuss next.\nRegarding our renovation pipeline, we're continuously assessing the health of each submarket for rent growth and renovation potential, and we're encouraged by the metrics we're seeing, particularly in our newly acquired suburban portfolio.\nSome submarkets in the metro area are experiencing widening rent gaps between Class A and Class B rents, which is an early indicator of renovation potential, while other submarkets continue to see rent gaps narrowing.\nWe are tracking these trends and will resume renovations when submarket fundamentals allow for rent increases that deliver appropriate ROI and when we know that capital allocation is accretive.\nThe final phase of Trove was delivered in the fourth quarter, and leasing momentum continues to build.\nDespite the lease-up process being interrupted by social distancing measures that halted on-site tours in April, we've made substantial progress and maintained a monthly lease-up rate above the long-term regional average in an extremely challenging environment.\nWe achieved breakeven in December and remain on track to reach stabilization in early 2022.\nWe project Trove to contribute $100,000 of income in the first quarter, increasing each quarter to approximately $1 billion by the fourth quarter of 2021, with significantly higher growth in 2022 compared to 2021 levels.\nShifting focus to commercial properties.\nAs anticipated, occupancy remained relatively stable through year-end.\nWhile we have only a small amount of signed new leases that haven't yet commenced rent (approximately 20,000 square feet) and about 20,000 square feet of signed LOIs for new leases expected to commence rent during 2021, we have minimal lease expirations in 2021.\nOur 2021 office lease expirations represent less than 3% of our overall revenue.\nWe believe that renewals are likely or we are in negotiations for renewal for over 60% of that space.\nWe lack sufficient visibility on the timing of the inflection point for new office leasing, but it will be driven by a combination of widespread vaccine distribution, school reopenings, and the general community returning to more normal activities.\nWhen that occurs, it will impact the timing of new lease commencements.\nWe have a forecast that could result in occupancy growth of up to 4%, but this forecast is at risk if new leasing is delayed.\nFor instance, that forecast includes slightly over $3 million of new leasing revenue in the fourth quarter.\nThis would be at risk if the inflection doesn't happen sooner.\nTherefore, we're not prepared to provide a guidance range yet without more visibility.\nFollowing two retail renewals executed in January, which represent 10% of our retail NOI, less than 3% of our retail revenue is set to expire in 2021.\nAlthough we're seeing recent signs of increased activity across our office portfolio, one of the most challenging predictions for us is when sentiment will improve and decision-making will accelerate to even higher levels, and when those additional lease commencements will begin.\nThat said, we believe we are well-positioned once activity improves.\nWe expect our office portfolio to be highly responsive to the economy reopening.\nThe majority of our vacancy is in high-quality space, some of which is in move-in ready condition.\nNearly 60% of our current vacancy is in Northern Virginia, where job growth and absorption rates were strongest and where we're seeing the most touring and leasing activity.\nParking revenue improved slightly over the course of 2020, driven by an increase in transient parking, but remains below normal levels.\nCompared to other major metropolitan areas, our parking coverage is higher, allowing more of our tenants to choose driving over public transportation.\nOur parking garages' capacity could serve over 50% of our building population before the pandemic on average, and we still currently have at least 50% parking capacity available, providing an option for companies wanting to encourage employees to return to the office before sentiment toward public transportation improves.\nWe are projecting a core FFO per share range of $0.29 to $0.32 for the first quarter.\nWe anticipate multifamily NOI to range from $20.25 million to $20.75 million, office NOI to range from $17.75 million to $18.5 million, and other NOI of approximately $3 million.\nG&A is expected to range from $6 million to $6.25 million; interest expense is projected to range from $10 million to $10.25 million; and development expenditures are anticipated to range from $5 million to $7.5 million.\nWe expect NOI to reach its lowest point in the first quarter, primarily due to our year-end asset sales.\nAfter the first quarter, barring any major setbacks to the current gradual reopening pace, we anticipate sequential growth throughout the year, driven by the lease-up of the Trove, the benefit of more favorable multifamily leasing seasons following the winter months, the phased resumption of unit renovations, and commercial rent commencements.\nConsequently, we expect our full-year results for 2021 to surpass the first quarter annualized results.\nSince our previous earnings call, we've sold two office assets and issued approximately 2 million shares through our ATM program at an average price of $23.86 per share to strengthen our balance sheet and position us to further enhance our capital allocation once visibility aligns with opportunities to increase multifamily holdings.\nCurrently, we don't plan to reinvest those proceeds in the near term.\nThus, we estimate that these two initiatives, net of their interest impact, will further strengthen our balance sheet and reduce full-year 2021 core FFO by approximately $0.09 per share.\nFor the full year, we project G&A to range from $22.25 million to $23.25 million and interest expense to range from approximately $41.5 million to $42.5 million.\nThese ranges don't assume any acquisitions are completed during the year.\nAdditionally, assuming leasing activity and utilization continue to increase and we achieve occupancy growth by year-end, we expect commercial operating expenses to rise by approximately $1 million by the fourth quarter from the first quarter expected range of $11.75 million to $12.25 million.\nWe believe that during 2021, vaccine distribution should create a positive recovery inflection point.\nFrom that point forward, we should see improvement with more to follow in 2022.\nDuring a challenging and unexpected year, we supported and protected our residents and tenants, stabilized our operating fundamentals, strengthened our balance sheet, and preserved long-term growth opportunities.\nWhile the timing of when we'll reach an inflection remains uncertain, we believe it will occur sometime in the second half of 2021 and that we're positioned for rapid improvement once we reach that point.\nOur region has several unique catalysts to accelerate the rebound in demand, including a strong economy and favorable demographics.\nHistorically, we've observed Washington office absorption increase significantly when the White House and both branches of Congress are aligned with one party, correlating with increased legislation, lobbying, and law implementation.\nThis presents promising opportunities that we'll be monitoring.\nWe also expect the apartment market in the region to receive a relative boost compared to other markets over the next six months based on historical patterns following Presidential elections, which should coincide with our strongest seasonal leasing months.\nLong-term, our research indicates that we should expect sustained growth in Northern Virginia, driven by government contracting, technology sector growth, and investments in higher education.\nWhile we certainly haven't emerged from the pandemic at this point, we're seeing signs of our multifamily occupancy strengthening, concessions starting to decline, and improvement in effective lease rates, all of which are positive trends heading into our stronger, seasonal leasing months.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:We will cover non-GAAP financial metrics, and a reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our online earnings materials.\nAfter excluding a special item with a net after-tax benefit of $32 million, our earnings were $450 million or $0.60 per diluted share.\nIn Q3, we achieved strong performance across all business units despite challenges from weather disruptions, the ongoing pandemic, and supply chain issues.\nOur staff did an outstanding job managing these obstacles, and I'm extremely grateful for their combined efforts and dedication to safely running our operations and maintaining customer service.\nExcellent execution throughout the entire supply chain in a challenging environment has led to record profits and cash flow in 2021.\nSo far this year, we've produced over $3.4 billion in adjusted EBITDA and $2.4 billion in adjusted funds available for distribution.\nLet's now examine our third quarter business results.\nI'll start by discussing Timberlands, which can be found on pages six to nine of our earnings presentation.\nTimberlands profits rose by $20 million in the quarter, including a $32 million gain from the previously announced sale of our North Cascades Timberlands.\nAdjusted EBITDA fell by $15 million compared to the previous quarter.\nIn the Western region, adjusted EBITDA decreased by $13 million compared to Q2.\nWestern domestic log markets began the quarter favorably despite declining lumber prices and sufficient log supply.\nDemand remained high as mills continued to increase log inventories during peak wildfire season, but weakened somewhat in September due to COVID-related disruptions affecting some producers and above-normal finished lumber inventories.\nDespite these challenges, our Q3 domestic sales realizations were similar to Q2, driven by strong domestic log prices in July and August.\nSalvage operations from the 2020 Oregon wildfires continued in the third quarter.\nOur teams have done an exceptional job managing these salvage efforts over the past year.\nWe've completed about 80% of our planned salvage harvest to date and expect to finish most of this work by year-end.\nAs anticipated, during the warmer and drier summer months, we shifted to higher elevation and more costly operations.\nAlthough we experienced minimal wildfire damage to our timberlands, active fires and dry conditions across the region limited our harvest activity in the quarter, especially in Oregon.\nConsequently, our fee harvest and domestic sales volumes were slightly lower in Q3, and per unit log and haul costs increased.\nRegarding our export markets, demand for our logs in Japan remained strong in Q3.\nLumber imports from Europe to Japan continue to be limited by the ongoing global shipping container shortage.\nThis situation is increasing market share for our customers and creating robust demand for our logs.\nAs a result, our Japanese log sales realizations moderately increased compared to Q2, and sales volumes were similar.\nIn China, demand for our logs remained favorable in the quarter despite seasonally lower consumption, COVID impacts on construction activity, and other supply chain disruptions.\nImports of lumber and logs into China continue to be constrained by global shipping container availability and the ban on Australian logs.\nConsequently, sales realizations for our China export logs moderately increased compared to Q2, but were outweighed by higher ocean freight rates.\nSales volumes to China were comparable to Q2.\nIn the Southern region, adjusted EBITDA for timberlands was similar to Q2.\nSouthern sawlog and fiber markets continued to strengthen as log supply was limited and mill inventories remained low due to ongoing wet conditions and significant weather events.\nAs a result, our sales realizations were slightly higher than Q2.\nFee harvest and sales volumes increased slightly in Q3, but fell below our planned activity level due to persistent wet weather and operational disruptions from Hurricane Ida.\nPer unit log and haul costs increased slightly in the quarter, as did forestry and road costs.\nOn the export side, we continue to see growing demand for our Southern logs.\nOur export log pricing increased substantially in Q3, but volumes were lower than Q2 as we continue to face challenges related to container availability and increased freight rates.\nIn the Northern region, adjusted EBITDA decreased slightly compared to Q2.\nSales volumes were significantly higher following spring breakup conditions, though sales realizations were lower due to mix.\nShifting to Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources on pages 10 and 11, this segment contributed $45 million to Q3 earnings and $60 million to adjusted EBITDA.\nQ3 adjusted EBITDA was $31 million lower than Q2 due to timing of transactions, but comparable to the same quarter last year.\nSimilar to 2020, our 2021 real estate sales activity has been heavily concentrated in the first half of the year.\nQ3 earnings more than doubled compared to Q3 2020 due to the mix of properties sold.\nWe continue to take advantage of strong demand for HBU properties, resulting in high-value transactions with significant premiums to timber value.\nLooking at Wood Products, pages 12 through 14, earnings and adjusted EBITDA decreased by about 60% compared to the previous quarter as lumber and OSB pricing declined substantially from record levels earlier in the year before stabilizing later in the quarter.\nAdditionally, weather events in the U.S. South, including Hurricane Ida, caused temporary downtime and lost production in our lumber business.\nThese issues, combined with COVID-related staffing disruptions, further aggravated transportation challenges in the region.\nDespite these obstacles, our teams performed well and delivered strong results.\nOur EWP business set a new quarterly EBITDA record in Q3, and the overall Wood Products segment has achieved year-to-date adjusted EBITDA of more than $2.8 billion.\nThe timber industry entered the third quarter with high inventory levels at home improvement stores and wood treatment facilities due to reduced DIY home repair and renovation activities.\nConsequently, prices continued to fall in July and much of August.\nThe market started to recover later in the quarter as retailers and treatment facilities depleted excess stock and consumer spending on DIY projects increased after Labor Day.\nThis coincided with steady demand from new home construction and professional repair and remodeling activities, which remained strong throughout the third quarter.\nThe lumber division's adjusted EBITDA fell by $686 million compared to the previous quarter.\nOur sales prices dropped by 52% in the third quarter, while the framing lumber composite price decreased by 61%.\nWe experienced a moderate increase in sales volume during the third quarter, and log costs rose slightly, mainly for Canadian logs.\nThe OSB market significantly weakened at the beginning of the third quarter due to a decline in DIY repair and remodeling activities.\nThis situation led to reduced sales and higher inventory levels at home improvement stores.\nAs a consequence, we saw a rapid decrease in prices from the record highs reached in July.\nPricing then stabilized above the historical average in August, as demand from robust new home construction continued and the market faced supply limitations due to ongoing resin availability and transportation issues.\nThis situation, along with a late-quarter improvement in DIY repair and remodel demand, caused prices to gradually increase through September.\nThe OSB division's adjusted EBITDA decreased by $128 million compared to the second quarter.\nOur sales prices fell by 24% in the third quarter, while the OSB composite price dropped by 43%.\nThis relative outperformance was primarily due to our higher proportion of premium OSB products.\nOur sales and production volumes improved slightly in the third quarter due to less downtime for scheduled maintenance.\nUnit manufacturing costs increased marginally, mainly due to higher resin expenses.\nEngineered Wood Products' adjusted EBITDA rose by $23 million compared to the second quarter, a 43% improvement.\nSales prices improved significantly for most products, and we continue to benefit from previously announced price increases for solid section and I-joist products.\nThis was partially offset by higher raw material costs for OSB webstock, resin, and veneer.\nSales and production volumes were moderately lower for most products due to planned annual maintenance during the quarter.\nIn the Distribution segment, adjusted EBITDA fell by $53 million compared to the second quarter.\nDespite lower sales volumes for most products and significantly reduced margins resulting from the commodity price correction, our teams performed exceptionally well, delivering $22 million of adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter.\nI'll start with our key financial items, which are summarized on page 16.\nWe generated $659 million in operating cash flow during the third quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to nearly $2.7 billion, our highest year-to-date operating cash flows on record.\nAdjusted funds available for distribution (adjusted FAD) for the year-to-date third quarter 2021 totaled over $2.4 billion, as shown on page 17.\nYear-to-date, we have returned $382 million to our shareholders through our quarterly base dividend payments, and we will supplement the base dividend annually with an additional cash return to achieve the targeted 75% to 80% of adjusted FAD.\nThis year, we plan to accomplish this entirely through a variable supplemental cash dividend.\nIn future years, we may also use opportunistic share repurchases for a portion of this cash return.\nThe supplemental dividend is typically paid in the first quarter of each year based on the previous year's cash flow.\nHowever, due to the record year-to-date performance, we accelerated a portion of the supplemental dividend by returning $375 million to our shareholders through a previously announced $0.50 per share interim supplemental dividend earlier this month.\nWe anticipate returning the remaining portion of the supplemental dividend with a substantial payment in the first quarter of 2022.\nDuring the third quarter, we also returned $26 million to shareholders through share repurchases.\nAdditionally, as previously announced, we authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program.\nAs always, we will consider repurchasing shares opportunistically when we believe it will create shareholder value.\nRegarding the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with approximately $2.3 billion in cash and just under $5.3 billion in debt.\nAfter the quarter ended, we repaid our $150 million 9% note at maturity, reducing our debt balance to $5.1 billion.\nFollowing this repayment, we have no additional maturities until 2023.\nLooking ahead, key outlook items for the fourth quarter are presented on page 18.\nIn our Timberlands business, we expect fourth quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA to be similar to the third quarter.\nFocusing on our Western Timberland operations, although domestic log inventories were higher than normal at the end of the third quarter, demand for finished lumber and logs has improved following a brief downturn in September.\nWe anticipate this trend continuing for most of the fourth quarter.\nConsequently, we expect our domestic sales prices to improve from the lower levels experienced in September.\nFor the fourth quarter, we anticipate our average domestic sales prices to be moderately lower than the elevated third quarter levels.\nAs Devin mentioned, we have made significant progress in our salvage operations in Oregon and expect our salvage volumes to decrease in the fourth quarter.\nAs a result, we expect fourth quarter fee harvest volumes to be moderately higher with lower per unit log and transportation costs.\nRegarding export markets, log demand in Japan remains favorable.\nWe anticipate our fourth quarter sales prices to be comparable to the elevated third quarter levels, partially offset by moderately lower sales volumes due to vessel timing.\nIn China, despite high log inventories at ports, demand for our logs is expected to remain favorable as construction activity increases seasonally and imports of lumber and logs continue to be limited from other countries.\nWe anticipate our fourth quarter sales volumes will exceed those of the third quarter, though this may be partially counteracted by slightly reduced sales prices.\nHigh shipping expenses and labor costs for loading vessels continue to pose challenges.\nWeather conditions in the South improved at the beginning of the fourth quarter.\nWe expect a slight increase in fee harvest volumes compared to the third quarter.\nMills are actively working to replenish low inventories due to ongoing wet conditions and reduced log availability, leading to sustained strong log demand.\nWe predict slightly higher sales prices in the fourth quarter as a result.\nThis increase is expected to be balanced out by marginally higher per unit log and transportation costs, as well as moderately increased forestry and road expenses, as some planned third-quarter activities were postponed due to weather disruptions.\nDue to persistent wet conditions in 2021 and significant weather events in the third quarter, we now expect full-year Southern fee harvest volumes to be similar to those of 2020.\nIn the North, we anticipate slightly lower sales prices due to mix changes and slightly reduced fee harvest volumes compared to the third quarter.\nShifting focus to our Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources division.\nFourth quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA are expected to be considerably lower than the third quarter due to the timing of transactions.\nWe maintain our prediction that full-year 2021 adjusted EBITDA will be around $290 million, and we now expect the basis as a percentage of real estate sales to be approximately 25% to 30% for the entire year.\nFor our Wood Products division, new residential construction activity remains robust, and demand from the repair and remodel sector continues to grow following the improvement in do-it-yourself activity in September.\nThis trend is expected to persist for most of the quarter before seasonally weakening as winter approaches.\nDisregarding changes in average sales prices for lumber and oriented strand board, we expect fourth quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA to surpass those of the third quarter.\nFor lumber, production volumes are anticipated to be similar to the third quarter.\nHowever, we expect our sales volumes to be slightly lower due to the inventory reduction experienced in the third quarter.\nWe anticipate this will be offset by slightly reduced log costs and improved unit manufacturing expenses.\nAs indicated on page 19, our current and quarter-to-date prices for lumber are slightly higher than the third quarter average.\nFor oriented strand board, we anticipate moderately higher sales volumes and improved unit manufacturing costs, primarily due to less downtime for planned maintenance during the fourth quarter.\nWe expect this will be partially counterbalanced by moderately higher fiber costs.\nAs shown on page 19, our current and quarter-to-date prices for oriented strand board are significantly lower than the third quarter average, but still elevated compared to historical norms.\nFor engineered wood products, we expect sales prices for solid section and I-joist products to remain stable, while prices for plywood will decrease.\nWe anticipate this will be more than offset by significantly lower raw material costs, primarily for OSB webstock.\nFor our distribution business, we're expecting higher adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter, mainly due to improved commodity margins, partially offset by seasonally lower sales volumes.\nI'll conclude with a few additional comments on our total company financial items.\nWe now expect our full-year capital expenditures to be slightly below our previous guidance of $460 million due to supply chain and contract labor constraints, with $15 million to $25 million potentially at risk.\nThe $90 million tax refund associated with our 2018 pension contribution was approved during the second quarter.\nHowever, we are still awaiting the refund.\nWe anticipate receiving it by the end of the fourth quarter of 2021.\nExcluding this refund, we now expect our full-year cash taxes to be slightly lower than tax expenses.\nDespite a slight decrease from the previous quarter, U.S. housing activity remained strong in the third quarter, with total housing starts and permits averaging around 1.6 million units on a seasonally adjusted basis.\nAlthough housing starts in 2021 continue at a robust pace, the time between starts and completions has extended as homebuilders face ongoing supply chain and labor availability challenges.\nDespite these obstacles, our customers inform us that they continue to expect strong demand for new home construction for the remainder of 2021.\nThe latest new home sales figures released earlier this week further support our positive view on the current state of the housing market.\nGiven favorable long-term demand fundamentals, including a decade of underbuilding and positive demographics, we maintain an optimistic outlook on U.S. housing activity well into the future.\nRegarding repair and remodel, we've continued to see strength in large professional projects throughout 2021 and expect that to persist for the rest of the year and into 2022.\nWhile we did observe some softening in the smaller do-it-yourself segment during the summer, demand has improved significantly since Labor Day, and we've continued to see strong demand from the repair and remodel segment through October.\nOverall, we maintain a favorable long-term outlook for repair and remodel activity, supported by numerous demand drivers, including an aging housing stock, rising home equity, and low interest rates.\nLastly, we hope you had the opportunity to participate in our virtual Investor Day on September 22, where we outlined a series of multiyear strategic growth targets, including expanding our Timberlands portfolio, developing our new Natural Climate Solutions business, and organically growing our lumber business.\nWe also announced several capital allocation actions and enhanced our ESG leadership by releasing our carbon record and announcing new greenhouse gas emission reduction targets.\nOur strategy, as outlined at Investor Day, is straightforward.\nWe aim to increase the value of our portfolio, improve our cash flows, build on our competitive advantage in the marketplace, and establish Weyerhaeuser as a premier ESG investment opportunity.\nThese actions will ensure that we generate superior returns for our investors, including returning significant amounts of cash to shareholders through a growing base dividend, a variable supplemental dividend, and opportunistic share repurchases, all while continuing to invest in our businesses and maintain an appropriate capital structure.\nWe're enthusiastic about Weyerhaeuser's future and are well-positioned to capitalize on strong macro trends driving continued growth and demand for our products and new opportunities for our businesses.\nWe greatly appreciate Beth's contributions to our IR function and look forward to her next opportunity at the company.\nWith Beth's transition, Andy Taylor has taken over the lead role of our Investor Relations program.\nAndy joined Weyerhaeuser in October of last year after an 18-year career in the energy industry, where he served in numerous leadership roles, including Investor Relations.\nHe's been a valuable addition to the Weyerhaeuser team, and we're excited to have him take on this new role.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:We eagerly anticipate discussing our exceptional third quarter results, recent changes to our capital allocation priorities, and providing an update on our strategic progress.\nAccompanying me today are Dave Burritt, U.S. Steel's President and CEO; Christie Breves, Senior Vice President and CFO; and Rich Fruehauf, Senior Vice President and Chief Strategy and Sustainability Officer.\nI'll now hand over the call to U.S. Steel President and CEO, Dave Burritt, who will begin with slide four.\nAs Kevin mentioned, we achieved unprecedented results in the third quarter, including record-breaking net earnings, EBITDA, EBITDA margin, and quality and reliability metrics.\nOur outstanding performance in the third quarter and throughout 2021 has significantly transformed our operations and showcases our progress towards excellence.\nBy the end of the year, we will have restructured our balance sheet by paying off over $3 billion in debt, achieving our deleveraging goal ahead of schedule.\nWe anticipate having approximately $5 billion in total liquidity, establishing a solid foundation to confidently implement our strategy and invest in our competitive advantages, positioning us for another strong year in 2022.\nOur improved balance sheet, ability to fund crucial strategic investments, and continued optimism about our business gives us confidence to return capital to shareholders while implementing the next phase of our Best for All strategy.\nWe believe the market is significantly undervaluing our progress and the value our strategy is creating, making now the ideal time to adopt a more balanced approach to capital allocation.\nOur strategy truly benefits everyone, including our shareholders.\nWe're delivering strong results year-to-date.\nA continued positive outlook for 2022 and beyond, along with expectations of an ongoing super cycle, allow us to accelerate the next phase of our strategy execution while beginning to reward shareholders with direct returns.\nOur primary challenges remain reducing our capital and carbon intensity.\nInvestments in mini mill steelmaking, such as constructing a second mini mill while investing in our competitive advantages, can help us achieve these goals and reposition the company for the future.\nThe solution involves moving towards a more balanced capital allocation strategy by successfully executing our Best for All strategy, including a second mini mill and an electrical steel line and coating line at Big River Steel.\nWe are swiftly progressing on our path forward by expanding our competitive advantages through strategic investments that help us achieve our objectives aligned with long-term value creation, improved through-cycle earnings and cash flow, and reduced capital and carbon intensity.\nWhether considering next year or our ability to build long-term value, we believe investors are undervaluing our progress and potential.\nOur customers, however, are noticing the transformation taking place at U.S. Steel and the importance of a regional supply chain.\nOur industry-leading finishing line capabilities are enhancing our value proposition, and customers are excited about the opportunities we are creating together.\nWhether it's advanced high-strength steels, differentiated electrical steels, or green and sustainable steels, discussions with customers are shifting from transactional to strategic.\nWe continue to create long-term value with customers by prioritizing innovation, differentiation, and strategic goals, and we look forward to building deeper relationships that unlock U.S. Steel's value for our customers and provide them with a reliable regional supply chain.\nSlide six further highlights our progress and performance.\nWe are encouraged by our record-setting performance, which is outpacing even the records achieved by direct competitors.\nHowever, there is still room for improvement.\nAs we've stated, our goal is to be the best steel competitor.\nWhile there are certainly more opportunities ahead, we've made significant progress quickly.\nAt U.S. Steel, we always prioritize safety, and I'm pleased with our team for continuing to emphasize safety and embodying our steel principles daily.\nRegarding our margin performance, our enterprise EBITDA margin reflects the disciplined, value-focused approach we've taken to our footprint.\nWith nearly $6 billion in quarterly revenue, our earnings quality demonstrates a business model increasingly built on capability and cost differentiation.\nFrom our iron ore advantage to our integrated assets, and from the newest mini mill in the country to the most efficient mill in Eastern Europe, our diversified footprint is extracting significant value from today's stronger for longer market.\nWhile competition isn't standing still, the actions we've taken over recent years to invest in our assets, streamline our footprint, and add capabilities have created significant value, leading to outperformance versus peers this quarter.\nOur mini mill performance continues to lead the industry, further widening its advantage over other mini mill producers.\nOur position as a mini mill leader creates the perfect platform for high-return investments in capabilities that expand our margins, reduce our carbon and capital intensity, and enhance our customer value proposition for sustainable green steel solutions.\nThese investments continue to be supported by strong liquidity, and we are moving forward with investments that create enduring value while rewarding stockholders for our progress so far.\nSlide seven expands on what makes U.S. Steel unique and why Best for All will continue to grow our competitive advantages.\nWe are investing to improve, not just expand, and are enhancing our three competitive advantages that differentiate us from competitors.\nThese advantages are: low-cost iron ore, lower greenhouse gas emission mini mill steelmaking, and best-in-class finishing capabilities.\nThese competitive advantages are built on a foundation of research and innovation and deep customer relationships.\nWe are pleased to report the first step in our metallic strategy, which shifts our iron ore advantage in Minnesota towards our growing fleet of EAFs.\nWe are finalizing an agreement with a strategic partner to produce up to 500,000 tons of pig iron annually at Gary Works.\nUnder the proposed deal, our potential partner would fund, install, and operate pig iron production assets, which we would supply with excess liquid iron production.\nThe proposed collaboration would improve Big River Steel's cost structure by insourcing valuable metallics while boosting blast furnace efficiency at Gary Works.\nPig iron production at Gary is expected to commence in early 2023, with permitting already underway.\nThis strategy efficiently expands our iron ore advantage to mini mills, and we're exploring additional ways to derive more value from iron ore.\nAdditional information about our investment in mini mill number two is provided on slide nine.\nWe recently began the process of selecting a site for constructing a new cutting-edge mini mill.\nThis new facility will offer specialized steelmaking supported by comprehensive finishing capabilities, including advanced high-strength steel galvanizing, hot-rolled galvanizing, painting, and slitting.\nWe're increasing our mini mill steelmaking capacity as we shift towards sustainable, lower-emission steel production.\nThis investment allows us to provide customers with more of the environmentally friendly steel they desire from like-minded partners such as U.S. Steel.\nWe're currently submitting permits in multiple states and aim to start construction as early as the first half of 2022.\nThe same experienced team that built Phase 2A of Big River Steel ahead of schedule, under budget, and fully operational in record time will construct mini mill number two.\nWe anticipate the value-added capabilities of mini mill number two will generate approximately $650 million in additional EBITDA contribution once fully operational.\nWe also announced plans yesterday to construct a new coating line at Big River Steel.\nDetails about this new line are available on slide 10.\nThis line will have an annual capacity of 325,000 tons and will sustainably produce both Galvalume and galvanized products.\nWe expect this investment to add another $60 million in annual run-rate EBITDA to Big River's already industry-leading results.\nThe line is projected to produce a mix of 75% Galvalume and 25% hot-dip galvanizing.\nGalvalume capabilities create opportunities to target the higher-value construction market, including exposed building panels.\nHot-dip galvanizing capabilities create additional opportunities to serve the appliance, automotive, and construction markets.\nOur investments at Big River are natural extensions of the campus and further utilize the state-of-the-art capabilities of the facility as we provide customers with sustainable steels to help meet their own decarbonization goals.\nAs we continue to showcase our industry-leading position at Big River, we're excited to expand our mini mill footprint, invest in downstream capabilities, and further enhance the commercial mix of our business model.\nOur progress in 2021 is undeniable.\nWe've transformed our balance sheet over the past several quarters.\nAt the beginning of the year, when we finalized the Big River Steel acquisition, we had $7 billion in debt and expect to end the year with $3.9 billion.\nWe've extended the maturity profile and anticipate next year's run-rate cash interest expense to be approximately $225 million.\nOur pension plan is overfunded, a favorable position that others in our industry are far from achieving.\nWe are in a clear position of strength.\nWhile we'll continue to consider further deleveraging as debt becomes callable, we're confident that this level of debt puts us in a sustainable and manageable position to support investments in our business.\nWe continue to believe that the greatest source of long-term value creation comes from investing in expanding competitive advantages that reshape our earnings profile and reduce our capital and carbon intensity.\nOur cash and liquidity position more than supports these high-return projects and allows us to execute with confidence.\nGiven the undeniable progress we've seen over the past several quarters, we are announcing enhancements to our capital allocation priorities that begin to directly reward stockholders with the improvements we've made to the business.\nWe believe the market is not fully valuing our expected strong performance in 2022 and has not yet recognized the long-term value creation potential of our Best for All strategy.\nOur strong financial performance and the significant returns we believe we can generate by buying our own stock is the reason we are accelerating direct returns to stockholders.\nReinstating the $0.05 per share quarterly dividend and quickly implementing a $300 million stock buyback demonstrates our commitment to ensuring our strategy is indeed best for all.\nWe aim to make direct returns an enduring part of our capital allocation strategy, and we believe there are catalysts that could drive additional buybacks in the future.\nBesides additional free cash flow generation, we believe there are near-term opportunities to divest non-core assets, primarily real estate, which could further accelerate or increase future authorizations.\nAdditionally, Stelco's option to acquire 25% of Minntac remains valid through January 2027 and presents an opportunity to return up to $500 million of additional capital to stockholders.\nChristie will now provide details about our quarterly performance before I share some thoughts on 2022.\nLet's begin with slide 12.\nAs Dave mentioned earlier, the third quarter was a record-breaking period.\nWe achieved adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA margin of over $2 billion and 34%, respectively.\nThis represents a nearly $750 million or 58% increase compared to the second quarter.\nAdjusted earnings per share for the quarter was $5.36 per diluted share.\nWe also generated approximately $1.3 billion in free cash flow during the quarter, including a $400 million investment in working capital.\nWe anticipate another quarter of robust cash flow generation in Q4.\nAllow me to elaborate on some crucial aspects of the balance sheet.\nSince the start of the year, we've paid off about $2.7 billion in debt and anticipate ending the year with $3.9 billion in debt on the balance sheet, an amount we believe is manageable and supports our business investments.\nThe quarter ended with a net debt to last 12 months EBITDA ratio of 0.6, and we expect to finish the year at 0.2.\nWith an improved balance sheet, 80% of our remaining debt due in 2029 or later, and a fully funded pension plan, we are in a strong position for future value creation.\nNow, let's discuss individual segments and fourth quarter expectations.\nOur Flat-Rolled segment achieved record EBITDA and EBITDA margin of over $1.1 billion and 32%, respectively.\nThis represents about a 60% improvement compared to Q2.\nThe positive impact of higher selling prices through our contract structure in Q3 is likely to continue into Q4.\nWe anticipate lower volumes due to our planned blast furnace outage at Gary Works and higher energy costs to offset this.\nWe currently predict Q4 Flat-rolled EBITDA to be close to our record Q3 performance.\nOur mini mill segment also set records for EBITDA and EBITDA margin.\nQ3 EBITDA was $464 million, or an industry-leading 42% EBITDA margin.\nIncreased prices continued to be reflected in the segment results, partially counterbalanced by higher scrap and other metallics costs.\nIn Q4, we expect higher prices to continue impacting the segments, mainly through monthly contracts.\nWe currently anticipate Q4 to be another record for our mini mill segment, potentially surpassing $500 million in EBITDA.\nUSSK also achieved record EBITDA and EBITDA margin in Q3.\nEBITDA reached $418 million, or a 33% EBITDA margin.\nA 60-day outage is planned for the number one blast furnace starting in November through year-end.\nThis will remove about 250,000 tons of steel equivalent capacity from the market in Q4.\nOperational challenges due to the planned outage, slightly lower shipments, and changes in European pricing dynamics are expected to result in lower Q4 EBITDA compared to Q3.\nI'd like to commend the USSK team for securing Slovakia's first revolving credit facility with sustainability-related performance targets.\nThe new €300 million unsecured sustainability-linked credit agreement reinforces our commitment to profitable sustainable steelmaking solutions and replaced the previous €460 million credit facility.\nOur Tubular segment reported similar results quarter-over-quarter.\nImproved commercial performance was largely offset by higher scrap and energy costs and continued high import levels.\nImports still account for roughly half of the U.S. tubular market.\nEarlier this month, we and the USW filed new OCTG trade cases.\nWe expect Q4 performance to be similar to Q3, as higher selling prices are offset by elevated scrap costs for the Fairfield EAF and ongoing high import levels.\nWe anticipate Q4 enterprise earnings to continue reflecting the strong market conditions as we end the year, and we currently believe our Q4 results will be close to our record Q3 performance.\nWe're entering 2022 in an excellent position to create value for stockholders and deliver value to customers.\nWe're conducting a thorough contract process with customers, often starting discussions 90 days earlier than usual.\nOur strategy is paying off.\nBased on the forward curve, which we consider a pessimistic view of spot prices, we fully expect average selling prices to be higher in 2022 than 2021 for our Flat-rolled segment.\nWe've also responded to customer feedback and in some cases, signed agreements beyond 12 months.\nThis creates longer-term benefits and supply continuity while fostering collaborative product development opportunities to address their most challenging issues.\nWe continue discussions on commercial terms beyond just price.\nWe're leveraging strong interest in advanced high-strength steels, our planned NGL electrical steel line, and other future sustainable steel offerings from U.S. Steel.\nCustomers value domestic supply chains, and we value their partnership.\nWe're pleased to hear from multiple auto customers that the worst of the chip shortage may be behind us.\nThey're starting to add to Q4 and Q1 build schedules and indicating increased usage rates as early as next week.\nKevin, let's move on to the Q&A session.\nWe request that each person limit themselves to one question and a follow-up to ensure everyone has a chance to ask a question.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Kristin Peck, our CEO, and Glenn David, our CFO, are with me today.\nOur discussion will include references to non-GAAP financial measures.\nWe will also mention operational results that don't account for foreign exchange impact.\nI trust you and your family are staying safe as we all continue to deal with the COVID-19 crisis.\nDespite the uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 situation, we exceeded expectations in the second quarter.\nOur revenue grew by 4% operationally, with 6% growth in the U.S. and 3% internationally.\nOur business performance is primarily driven by companion animal products, which saw 13% operational growth, while livestock products decreased by 5%.\nIn the second quarter, our adjusted net income grew by 4% operationally.\nWe've developed a robust companion animal portfolio in recent years through our in-house innovation.\nThese offerings have helped mitigate some of the more severe challenges currently faced in the livestock market.\nOur newly introduced parasiticides, Simparica Trio, ProHeart 12 and Revolution Plus, along with our key dermatology products Apoquel and Cytopoint, provide a strong foundation that has maintained its performance this year.\nWe continue to be impressed by the performance of Simparica Trio, our new triple-combination parasiticide for dogs, as well as the overall strength of the Simparica line.\nGlenn will provide more information in his presentation.\nOur ongoing commitment to meaningful innovation and our diverse portfolio across species, products, and regions remain key advantages for Zoetis during economic uncertainty.\nWe've also observed that the essential nature of animal health has played a crucial role in the resilience of our business and industry during this time.\nRegarding COVID-19, our veterinary and producer clients are facing increased pressure to provide crucial animal care and maintain a stable global food supply, and we're fortunate to be able to support them in this mission.\nWe prioritize the safety of our employees and customers during this pandemic, and we're pleased with our team's ability to maintain productivity despite safety measures and social distancing adjustments at our facilities, as well as the continued use of remote work arrangements for most of our staff.\nOur field teams have resumed customer meetings in many areas based on local guidelines and practices.\nWe monitor and adjust these plans daily based on local feedback and changes in markets that may be experiencing increased COVID-19 cases.\nOur teams are eager to reconnect with customers in person, but we're also incorporating the lessons learned from effective online interactions, webinars, and e-commerce to improve our sales and support methods.\nZoetis has maintained a reliable supply of essential medicines, vaccines, and diagnostics for our customers and distributors in over 100 markets worldwide.\nOur research and development programs remain on schedule in terms of filings, clinical trials, and interactions with regulatory agencies.\nWe're confident in the progress of regulatory reviews for our monoclonal antibody candidates for pain in cats and dogs.\nOur submissions are proceeding as expected.\nThis year continues to present unprecedented challenges due to COVID-19 and related trends affecting our customers.\nHowever, the underlying demand for healthy pets and a reliable protein source remains fundamental to the global economy.\nIn the second quarter, we benefited from U.S. veterinary clinics recovering from the COVID-19 impact much faster than anticipated.\nVeterinary practices in the U.S. quickly adapted to curbside visits and mobile clinics to provide essential care and maintain client relationships.\nWe also witnessed an increase in companion animal product sales through e-commerce channels due to lockdowns in many states.\nVeterinarians and pet owners are embracing online options more readily as a means to fill prescriptions for parasiticides and other medications.\nWe've also noticed that people are spending more time at home with their pets.\nThey may be observing conditions like itchiness or pain that previously went unnoticed.\nAs a result, we're seeing an increase in spending per visit at U.S. clinics.\nOutside the U.S., companion animal veterinary clinic performance has met expectations despite significant variations between markets based on local conditions.\nFor Zoetis, we anticipate our overall revenue growth for the rest of the year will be primarily driven by companion animal products, particularly our parasiticides and key dermatology portfolio.\nWe plan to continue investing in direct-to-consumer advertising and digital marketing to support these products.\nThe livestock sector presents a very different scenario and remains significantly challenged by the pandemic, especially in the U.S. Producers are adapting to new market demands and distribution needs, shifting from foodservice and restaurant channels to more grocery and retail channels, while also managing ongoing labor, safety, and trade issues.\nAs anticipated, U.S. livestock saw a significant decline in the second quarter, and we expect this to remain a challenge for the rest of the year.\nThe speed at which foodservice and restaurant demand returns, along with increased export opportunities, will be the most crucial factors in the recovery of U.S. livestock producers.\nInternationally, livestock grew and performed as expected across various markets.\nWe saw very positive results in places like China, which is further along in its COVID-19 recovery, but we'll be watching closely to see how Latin America and markets like Brazil perform in the remainder of the year due to COVID.\nLooking ahead, we remain focused on advancing our five key priorities to ensure long-term success: driving innovative growth, enhancing customer experience, leading in digital and data analytics, cultivating a high-performing organization, and championing a healthier, more sustainable future.\nWe've continued to make significant investments in products and innovations across the continuum of care, from prediction and prevention to detection and treatment of disease.\nSupporting successful launches, as well as new life cycle innovations and expansions of major products into new markets, continue to be the cornerstones of our durable and steady performance.\nIn the second quarter, we expanded major vaccine franchises with the approval of Vanguard B Oral for dogs in Brazil and our Fostera Gold PCV MH and Fostera Gold PCVMetastim vaccines for pigs in Australia.\nWe continue to enhance our diagnostic and digital capabilities, building upon recent acquisitions in point-of-care and reference laboratories, as well as additional investments.\nWe intend to introduce a new diagnostic platform for veterinary care called VetScan Imagyst in the third quarter.\nWe are thrilled about the potential of this groundbreaking innovation, which will be the pioneering system to bring clinical pathology directly to the point of care.\nThis innovative multipurpose platform combines image recognition technology, algorithms, and cloud-based AI to provide swift testing results in clinics.\nIts initial application will be for analyzing fecal samples to detect parasites, enabling quick testing and treatment of pets during the same visit.\nWe will provide more information in the upcoming weeks as we prepare for a worldwide launch.\nWe also consider diagnostics to play a crucial role in the comprehensive care of fish.\nIn the second quarter, we acquired Fish Vet Group to expand our aquaculture portfolio with additional diagnostic tools, including environmental testing, which is vital for fish farming.\nAt Zoetis, our main focus on high-performing teams is linked to fostering a culture where all employees feel appreciated and included, reflected in our dedication to promoting inclusion, diversity, and equity throughout our organization.\nOur leadership and Board are committed to being catalysts for positive change globally to promote greater equity and inclusion.\nWe have allocated financial resources and personnel to achieve this goal.\nI'll now pass it over to Glenn, who will discuss our second quarter results and revised guidance for the entire year.\nI hope everyone is well, in good health, and adjusting to what is undoubtedly an unprecedented period for us all.\nToday, I will offer additional insights on our Q2 financial performance, provide an update on our liquidity status, and review our improved full-year 2020 forecast.\nLet's start with the second quarter results.\nWe achieved revenue of $1.5 billion, which remained flat on a reported basis but grew 4% operationally.\nAdjusted net income of $427 million decreased 2% on a reported basis but increased 4% operationally.\nForeign exchange had a negative impact of 4% on revenue in the quarter.\nThis was primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Brazilian real, Australian dollar, Mexican peso, and euro.\nThe 4% operational revenue growth was driven by 2% price and 2% volume increases.\nThe 2% volume growth includes 3% from new products, 3% from key dermatology products, 1% from acquisitions, and a 5% decline in other in-line products.\nCompanion animal products led species growth, increasing 13% operationally, while livestock declined 5% operationally.\nCompanion animal performance was driven by our parasiticide portfolio, including sales of Simparica Trio in the U.S., Canada, and certain European markets, as well as our key dermatology products, Apoquel and Cytopoint.\nRevenue from the acquisition of Platinum Performance and its nutritional products, acquired in the second half of 2019, drove growth in the equine sector.\nLivestock declines in the quarter were due to challenges in our U.S. livestock portfolio.\nSupply chain disruptions caused by reduced animal processing capacity and shifts in consumer demand from restaurants and foodservice to grocery stores affected our customers' purchasing decisions.\nThis decline was partially offset by strong international performance with growth in swine, fish, and poultry.\nNew products contributed 3% to overall growth in the quarter, driven by Simparica Trio, ProHeart 12, Revolution Plus, and our Alpha Flux parasiticide for salmon in Chile.\nWe remain optimistic about the launch of Simparica Trio and are reaffirming the range of $100 million to $125 million for full-year incremental revenue.\nTrio has been more robust, and cannibalization of Simparica has been less than anticipated.\nGlobal sales of our key dermatology portfolio reached $224 million in the quarter, growing 24% operationally and contributing 3% to overall revenue growth.\nRecent acquisitions contributed 1% growth this quarter, including Platinum Performance and our reference lab expansion strategy.\nNow let's examine the revenue growth by segment for the quarter.\nU.S. revenue increased by 6%, with companion animal products growing 19% and livestock products declining by 18%.\nCompanion animal growth in the quarter was driven by sales of the Simparica franchise, our key dermatology products, and the impact of recent acquisitions.\nU.S. key dermatology sales were $160 million for the quarter, growing 26%.\nThe continued strength of this portfolio was driven by expanded usage of both Cytopoint and Apoquel, benefiting from our direct-to-consumer campaign, uptake in e-commerce channels, and pet owners spending more time with their pets due to COVID-19.\nSimparica Trio performed well in the U.S. with sales of $36 million despite challenging market conditions in Q2.\nWe are observing several positive trends, including rapid uptake in clinics that have adopted Trio, smaller-than-expected cannibalization of Simparica, sales coming from new patients to the category, and taking market share from current oral flea and tick competitors.\nDiagnostic sales increased 18% in the quarter, largely driven by our reference lab acquisitions.\nAdditionally, previous instrument placements created a solid foundation for consumables growth in the second quarter.\nU.S. livestock declined 18% in the quarter, driven by lower sales across all species.\nIn the second quarter, we faced challenges with significant declines in feedlot placements, reduced demand from the foodservice industry and the effects that had throughout the food supply chain and our customers, in addition to increased competition.\nIn summary, the U.S. showed robust performance despite challenging market conditions.\nThe varied nature of our product range proved advantageous, with growth in pet care offsetting difficulties faced by our livestock division in the U.S.\nOur International division experienced a 3% operational revenue increase in Q2, with balanced growth across both pet care and livestock sectors.\nPet care operational revenue grew by 2%, while livestock operational growth was 4%.\nThe rise in pet product sales was due to expansion in our main dermatology line and our Simparica brand, including the introduction of Simparica Trio in Canada.\nAlthough European markets were heavily impacted by COVID-19, the decline was counterbalanced by significant growth in other regions, such as Japan and China.\nThe diagnostics sector struggled as widespread clinic closures due to COVID-19 hindered equipment placement and reduced consumable usage.\nInternational livestock growth in the quarter was led by increases in swine, fish, and poultry sectors.\nSwine experienced double-digit growth, primarily driven by a 25% increase in China, as major clients expanded their herds and production shifted from smaller farms to larger operations.\nOur fish products had another successful quarter.\nFavorable conditions in Chile and Norway led to vaccinations being moved up to Q2.\nAdditionally, we continue to see increased adoption of the Alpha Flux parasiticide in Chile.\nOverall, our international division once again contributed positively to revenue growth, with performance in swine, pet care, fish, and poultry more than making up for the decline in cattle due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nNow let's look at the rest of the financial statement.\nAdjusted gross margin slightly increased to 71.1% compared to last year, due to pricing, favorable manufacturing costs, and product mix, partially offset by foreign exchange, recent acquisitions, and higher inventory charges.\nAdjusted operating expenses remained flat operationally.\nThe additional advertising and promotion costs for Simparica Trio, recent acquisitions, and R&D increases were mostly offset by reductions in travel, entertainment, and compensation-related expenses due to COVID-19.\nThe adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.3%.\nThe increase from last year is due to the mix of earnings across jurisdictions and the impact of specific tax benefits recorded in Q2 2019.\nAdjusted net income for the quarter grew 4% operationally, mainly driven by revenue growth, and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 6% operationally.\nI'd now like to discuss our liquidity position and capital allocation priorities.\nWe concluded the second quarter with about $3.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents, including proceeds from our $1.25 billion long-term debt issuance in May, of which $500 million is set aside for repaying our November 2020 maturity.\nWe have access to a $1 billion revolving credit facility and a corresponding commercial paper program, both currently unused.\nGiven our strong cash flow and balance sheet, we remain committed to our capital allocation priorities for internal investment, mergers and acquisitions, and returning excess cash to shareholders.\nAs mentioned last quarter, we still expect higher capital expenditures this year to support investments in manufacturing, information technology for our recent acquisitions, and capabilities in digital and data analytics.\nRegarding returning excess cash to shareholders, we remain committed to our 2020 dividend, which is a 22% increase over 2019.\nIn Q1, we bought back $250 million in Zoetis shares before pausing the program in the second quarter to conserve cash.\nWe have approximately $1.4 billion remaining in our multi-year share repurchase program.\nNow let's move on to our revised guidance assumptions for 2020.\nOur past performance has consistently given us confidence that the essential nature of our business, our diverse portfolio, and our continuous innovation would position us well during challenging market conditions.\nAfter evaluating recent trends and our second quarter performance, we are further refining and increasing our full year 2020 guidance.\nWe anticipate that recent positive trends in companion animal care in the U.S. will continue, although veterinary clinic revenue may moderate somewhat as pent-up demand is satisfied.\nThe recent resurgence of COVID-19 cases in parts of the U.S. and increasing infection rates in international markets continues to create uncertainty about the duration, scope, and economic impact of the pandemic.\nPlease note that our guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of mid-July.\nGiven our global presence, changes in foreign exchange have impacted revenue and adjusted net income since we issued our previous guidance in May.\nOur current guidance includes a favorable foreign exchange impact of approximately $50 million on revenue and about $10 million on adjusted net income compared to May guidance.\nFor revenue, we are raising and narrowing our guidance range with projected revenue now between $6.3 billion and $6.475 billion, and operational revenue growth between 3% and 6% for the full year, compared to the negative 2% to positive 3% range in our May guidance.\nAdjusted net income is now expected to be between $1.685 billion and $1.765 billion, representing operational growth of 1% to 5%, compared to our previous guidance of negative 9% to negative 2%.\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share is now expected to be between $3.52 and $3.68, and reported diluted earnings per share to be between $3.14 and $3.32.\nIn conclusion, while the COVID-19 pandemic has certainly presented unprecedented challenges, we are extremely proud of our colleagues and their commitment to our customers, our company, and animal healthcare.\nDuring this time, we have demonstrated the diversity and durability of our portfolio and the resilience of our industry.\nWe are confident in our ability to continue executing our strategy during these uncertain times.\nSummary: ",
